They promise a future \nwhere every drop of water, every ounce of fertiliser, and every hour of labour \nis optimised, leading to higher yields and, crucially, higher incomes.\nOur approach is holistic and systemic. The roadmap proposes a Digital Ag­\nriculture Mission 2.0 and outlines key recommendations across three pillars: \nEnhance, Reimagine, and Converge.\nEnhance: Agriculture’s foundational systems by focusing on a 360-degree \ndata ecosystem, digital enablement of the last-mile interventions and up­\ngrading the AgriTech startup accelerator ecosystem.\nReimagine: Future-ready, globally competitive talent & innovation eco­\nsystems, focusing on a shift to translational R&D, interdisciplinary indus­\ntry-aligned talent and revamping the institutional architecture for innovation\nConverge: Build instruments for public-private dialogue to align industry and \ngovernment efforts for agile policy making and accelerated transformation\nThe journey ahead requires unprecedented collaboration. NITI Aayog is \ncommitted to championing the policy and governance frameworks required \nto unlock this potential. I call upon all our partners -State Governments, \nresearch institutions, private enterprises, technology developers, and, most \nimportantly, the millions of farmers who are the primary stakeholders- to \nembrace this vision. Let us translate this strategic intent into decisive action, \nensuring that India’s agricultural sector makes a transformative leap, becom­\ning a global benchmark for resilience, productivity, and prosperity.\nThe time for transformation is now. Together, we will sow the seeds of a \nhigh-tech, high-impact agricultural future for India.\nB.V.R. Subrahmanyam\nChief Executive Officer, NITI Aayog\nForeword",
    "answer": "griculture stands on the brink of a profound technological renaissance. \nFor decades, our progress in this sector has been measured in hectares \nand yields; the next revolution will be measured in data, intelligence, \nand design. This is the new norm, and success will not be defined by \nwhether we transform, but by how fast we do.\nThe NITI Frontier Tech Hub’s Roadmap brings together what I believe \nis the most critical insight of our time:  that India’s leadership in \nagriculture will not be determined by how much technology we adopt, \nbut by how intelligently we integrate and scale it. \nThe shift ahead will be defined by four major transitions:  from data \nscarcity to sovereign agri data systems; from fragmented advisory to \nAI-powered, real-time decision networks; from isolated lab research \nto mission-driven, translational R&D; and from fragmented funding to \npatient, long-term capital that supports deep innovation.\nThe roadmap reminds us that data is the new soil, AI the nervous \nsystem, and biotechnology the new seed infrastructure of Indian \nagriculture. Yet, its most important message is that these technologies \nwill mean little unless we reimagine the institutions, incentives, \nand talent systems that bring them to life,  building a generation of \nAI-literate, tech-enabled farmers and agri-entrepreneurs who can \nlead India’s next great transformation.\nOur goal must be clear: to make agriculture not just more productive, \nbut more predictive, resilient, and equitable,  to move from fragmented \ninterventions to a connected ecosystem that learns, adapts, and scales.\nIf the Green Revolution fed India, this Intelligent Revolution must \nempower it,  ensuring that every farmer becomes not just a user of \ntechnology, but a co-creator of the future of food.\nDebjani Ghosh\nDistinguished Fellow, NITI Aayog\nChief Architect, NITI Frontier Tech Hub\nForeword\nAgricultural transformation lies at the heart of India’s \nvision to become a developed nation by 2047. Recognising \nagriculture’s critical role in ensuring economic resilience, rural \nprosperity, and food security, frontier technologies such as \nseed technologies, verticalised farming, digital twins, precision \nagriculture and smart sensors, agentic AI, predictive analytics, \nand advanced mechanisation offer unprecedented possibilities \nto significantly enhance productivity, sustainability, and \nfarmer incomes.\nAs India embarks on this transformative journey, it is important \nto recognise the diversity of the country’s agricultural and \nfarming landscape - from rain-dependent smallholders to \ncommercial-scale cultivators, farmers face diverse challenges \nand demand tailored solutions. To keep the insights real and \nrecommendations actionable, we have segmented the farming \ncommunity into three primary archetypes - ‘Aspiring farmers \n(70–80%)’, ‘Transitioning farmers (15–20%)’, and ‘Advanced \nfarmers (1–2%)’. Throughout this roadmap, our findings and \nsuggestions are contextualised to these farmer archetypes. \nWhile the holistic agriculture and allied ecosystem includes \ndairy, poultry, fisheries and livestock, in this phase of our work, \nwe have focused exclusively on crop production.\nThrough our detailed analysis, we identify six systemic barriers \nthat are currently limiting technology scale-up and impeding \nthe transformation of Indian agriculture. These include siloed \nagricultural data systems, trust deficits among farmers, a \npersistent ‘phygital divide’ between digital innovations and \nphysical infrastructure, ecosystem fragmentation restricting \nscalable \nsolutions, \ntalent \ngaps \naffecting \ntechnology \nimplementation, and constrained capital flows, especially for \nearly-stage agri-tech enterprises. The roadmap recommends \nan actionable three-pillar framework for a Digital Agriculture \nMission 2.0 to address prevailing barriers and advance \nagricultural transformation:\nExecutive Summary\n1.\t Enhance foundational systems which can take the \nbenefits of the digital infrastructure being built to the \nfarm via robust last-mile advisory services and dynamic \nagri-tech innovation ecosystems. \n2.\tProactively reimagine research and talent systems \nby fostering interdisciplinary, mission-oriented research, \nadaptive regulatory environments, and targeted skills \ndevelopment. \n3.\tInstitutionalise centres of excellence and policy \nforesight units to converge public-private efforts, \naligning policymaking and regulatory framework with \nnational priorities, market needs, research agendas, and \ninclusive grassroots dissemination strategies to accelerate \ntransformation.\nPrimarily articulated for policymakers and government \nbodies, this strategic framework serves as a vital resource \nto shape enabling environments and coherent interventions. \nEqually, it supports agribusinesses, innovators, academia, \nand development organisations, helping align their strategic \ninvestments \nand \ninnovations \nwith \nnational \npriorities. \nImportantly, this is a living document, intended to continuously \nevolve as new insights, technologies, and threats emerge, \nensuring that India’s strategic response remains relevant, \nresilient, and future-ready.\nThrough decisive action and collaborative engagement, India \ncan realise an optimistic future, transforming agriculture into \na dynamic, globally competitive sector and securing inclusive \nrural prosperity aligned with the nation’s vision for 2047.\n10 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 11 \nINDEX\n1. \u0007INTRODUCTION: AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION FOR A VIKSIT \nBHARAT\n6\n1.1 The Imperative: Transform Farmer Livelihoods\n6\n1.2 Frontier Technologies as a Lever for Transformation\n6\n2. \u0007INDIA’S AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE: CHALLENGES & THE ROLE OF \nFRONTIER TECHNOLOGY\n9\n2.1 Farms & Farmers: The Current Landscape\n9\n2.2 Frontier Technologies in Indian Agriculture: Opportunities\n13\n2.3 Gaps and Breakdowns in Technology Application\n14\n3. \u0007UNLOCKING AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION FOR INDIA WITH \nFRONTIER TECH\n17\n3.1 Systemic Roadblocks Hindering Agricultural Transformation\n17\n3.2 A Vision of the Future: Accelerating Progress Towards Viksit  Bharat Goals\n18\n4. \u0007DEFINING THE PATH AHEAD FOR SCALING UP OF FRONTIER \nTECHNOLOGIES\n21\n4.1 Enhance foundational systems through Digital Agriculture Mission 2.0\n22\n4.2 Reimagine Agri-Innovations & Agri-Talent Systems for Future-readiness\n27\n4.3 Converge Industry Knowledge with Public Policymaking\n30\n5.

INTRODUCTION: AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION FOR A VIKSIT BHARAT\n1.1 The Imperative: Transform Farmer Livelihoods\nIndia’s agriculture must become a cornerstone of a developed India\n- The Hon’ble PM of India at Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan      \nAgriculture and Food Systems will be a key driver of Viksit Bharat, shaping several critical national \nimperatives: food and nutritional security, rural livelihoods, climate adaptation, and global trade \ncompetitiveness. Employing 45.8% of the national workforce1  and producing nearly 1 billion tons2 of \nfood annually, the sector underpins employment generation, national health outcomes, and inclusive \neconomic growth. For India to achieve the status of a developed nation by 2047, its per capita \nGross National Income (GNI) must rise fivefold3, a goal inseparable from achieving a commensurate \nincrease in agrarian incomes and productivity.\nOver the last decade, agriculture and allied sectors have witnessed a steady 3-5% CAGR, fuelled by \nextensive government efforts, private innovations, and sizeable domestic demand. It is estimated \nthat by 2047, the sector could potentially triple in size, powering India’s growth. \nDespite measured success, persistent challenges such as fragmented landholdings, low productivity, \nlimited downstream linkages, and the rising impact of climate change continue to constrain overall \nsectoral growth. Over 86% of Indian farmers are smallholders, with an average landholding size \nof 0.74 hectares4. Reliance on resource-intensive practices, compounded by limited irrigation \nand mechanisation, exacerbates the farmers’ vulnerability to extreme weather shocks, rapid soil \ndegradation and groundwater depletion. Substantial post-harvest losses, exceeding USD 18 billion \nin 2022 alone5, inequitable value chains, and asymmetric bargaining power further depress farmer \nincomes. Further, systemic gaps in access to finance, insurance buffers, and entrenched digital \ndivides leave millions of farmers unable to benefit from existing solutions.\nTo unlock the next economic leap for the country and boost farmer incomes, a paradigm shift \nis needed. Structural reforms, last-mile enablement, and deep technological innovations will be \ncritical to improving agricultural productivity, minimising post-harvest losses, accelerating the \nexport footprint, and increasing the sustainability and climate resilience of food systems.    \n1.2 Frontier Technologies as a Lever for Transformation  \nFrontier technologies offer a transformative opportunity for Indian agriculture to overcome these \nstructural challenges, especially as mounting complexities render conventional interventions \ninadequate. These technologies act both as standalone end solutions and as enablers to critical \nsolutions across the agricultural value chain, as demonstrated in Exhibit 1.1. Globally, cutting-edge \ntechnologies like CRISPR seeds, biostimulants, biofertilizers and biochar are improving yields \nsustainably, increasing soil health and mitigating climate rishks, while precision irrigation systems, \npredictive analytics, modified atmosphere packaging, etc., are minimising input costs and wastage. \nAt the forefront of this are seed technologies. Advances in this domain can directly and decisively \naddress India’s most pressing agricultural challenges to unlock transformation. High-yielding \nvarieties substantially boost productivity per land parcel, pest-resistant plants improve crop quality \n1   The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for 2023 \n2 \u0007Business as usual estimations of total food production from crops and animal products by NITI Aayog’s Working Group \nReport on Crop Husbandry, Agriculture Inputs, Demand & Supply (2024)\n3 16th Finance Commission Chairman highlighted 7.3% growth in dollar terms required over next 24 years\t\n4 NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) conducted for the year 2021-22\n5 Study to determine post-harvest losses of Agri produces in India by MoFPI and NABCONS\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 13 \nat reduced costs and pesticide use, while climate-resilient and drought-tolerant varieties safeguard \nyields against unpredictable environmental shocks, and biofortified seeds enhance nutritional profiles \nwithout additional strain on natural resources, serving critical nutrition security goals. On the other \nhand, AI has emerged as a powerful enabler. Pilots such as Telangana’s AI-enabled advisory have \ndelivered promising results with 21% yield increases, 11% price gains, and 9% reduction in input use in \na single season6. AI-enabled precision advisory, coupled with a digitally enabled last-mile network, \ncan amplify the reach and timeliness of technology diffusion while AI-powered underwriting using \nalternate data can unlock credit for underbanked populations, increasing their capacity to adopt \nnew solutions. Drone and satellite-based field intelligence, cell-based solutions, meanwhile, provide \nsolutions tailored to remote geographies and small landholdings. \nInitiatives like the Digital Agricultural Mission, National Mission on Agriculture & Technology, Kisan \nDrone Scheme, and National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture have made strides in enhancing \nagricultural outcomes and improving the on-farm effectiveness of technologies in India. Achieving \nsustained, inclusive transformation requires accelerating the integration and scaling of frontier \ntechnologies, bridging current implementation gaps, and fostering an enabling environment for \ncontinuous innovation.\n6 \u0007Saagu Baagu pilot in Telangana delivered AI-based advisory, quality-testing and e-commerce services to 7000+ chili \nfarmers in phase 1\n14 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nFrom Seed to Sale: Frontier Tech can unlock value across the \nfarmer lifecycle\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\nExhibit 1.1: From Seed to Sale: Frontier technologies unlock value across the farmer lifecycle  \nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 15 \n2. \u0007INDIA’S AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE: CHALLENGES & THE ROLE OF \nFRONTIER TECHNOLOGY\n2.1 Farms & Farmers: The Current Landscape\nFrontier technologies, in the context of Indian agriculture, need to be tailored to account for the \nheterogeneity of the country’s farmers. From rainfed, subsistence smallholders to progressive, \ncommercial-grade cultivators, each farmer faces a unique set of challenges and seeks curated \nsolutions. Hence, this section segments farmers into three distinct, yet broad, archetypes based on \ntheir incomes (detailed calculations in Appendix 1), landholding size, irrigation, cropping pattern, \ntech adoption and needs, along with corresponding illustrative examples.  \n17,000 - \n60,000\n<2\nMarginal and small\nPredominantly rainfed \n(~60%)⅓ , 20-30% irrigate \nvia borewells, canals⅔\nSingle or dual cropping; \npredominantly \nfood grains\nLow adoption, need to \nbuild access & \nconﬁdence in technology\n1.Net income (Revenue from sale of crops – Cost of inputs, irrigation and labor) per hectare per year.

Lack of timely and reliable advisory, resource \nconstraints and working capital shortages prevent the adoption of \nhigh-yielding seeds, mechanised tools and micro-irrigation solutions. \nThus, he is entirely dependent on monsoons and droughts, and even \na few weeks of delayed rains can damage his crop. Without a tractor \nor power tiller, he and his family prepare the field manually. During \nseasons with adequate rainfall, he plants vegetables on small patches \nof land. Lacking proper storage and direct market linkages, this year \nmost of his crop spoiled, and he was forced to sell at a distress price, \nearning barely INR 30,000 from farming. This makes farming a high-\nrisk, low-margin endeavour, necessitating supplemental income \nthrough casual labour.\nAge: 55 years\nLand size: 0.5 Ha\nIrrigation: Rainfed\nCrops: Single (wheat)\nMechanisation: None; \nown labour\nTransitioning Farmers: \nMedium-holder, irrigated, multi-crop, tech curious, entrepreneurial yet market-constrained\n 15–20% OF FARMERS\nMeet Bindu, a farmer cultivating three hectares with access to \ncanal and borewell irrigation. This permits multi-cropping, growing \npaddy during the kharif season and diversifying to higher-value \nvegetables and pulses during the rabi season. Due to the high costs \nof labour and mechanisation, she and neighbouring farmers jointly \nhire a tractor for ploughing. Keen to adopt cost-effective, proven \ntechnologies, Bindu uses her smartphone for weather updates, price \ninformation, and generalised advisory through social media, but \nactively seeks personalised support. Some of the latest technologies \nare also not suited to the scale of her farm. Last year, she tested a \nnew hybrid tomato seed, yielding higher returns but also grappled \nwith pest outbreaks. Post-harvest she struggles to fetch fair prices: \nLocal agents rarely offer optimal rates, but she lacks access to better \nmarkets. She considered transporting to city markets, but her yields \nlacked the scale to be feasible for independent transportation. Lack \nof storage and processing facilities also prevents her from fetching \noptimal prices. With the right support, entrepreneurial farmers like \nBindu can become engines of growth for Indian agriculture, investing \nin their practice for higher returns.  \nAge: 32 years\nLand size: 3 Ha\nIrrigation: Borewell & \nCanal\nCrops: Paddy & \nvegetables\nMechanisation: Rented \ntractor and power tiller\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 17 \nAdvanced Farmers\nLarge-scale, capital-intensive export-oriented, innovation-seeking, but ecosystem-constrained\n 1–2% OF FARMERS \nConsider Aman, an agri-entrepreneur and large-scale farmer \noperating 12 hectares of export-grade grape vineyards and tomato \ncrops. He has installed an automated sensor-based drip fertigation \nsystem complemented by precision tools for canopy management. \nHe imports grape pruning tools and was the first to experiment with \na high-Brix variety to maximise quality and comply with stringent \nexport standards. Despite his commercial savvy and influential \nmarket position, he struggles to navigate the complex regulatory \nrequirements and extensive paperwork. His yields have plateaued \nrecently; thus, he is seeking disease-resistant & high-yielding vines. \nShortage of technically trained labour & rising costs also push Aman \nto explore automated harvesters. However, neither technologies are \nnot yet available in India.

Structural challenges in Indian agriculture\n18 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nA holistic approach with structured pathways is needed to transition farmers from aspiring to \nadvancing, one that simultaneously improves productivity, lowers losses, links farmers to markets, \nand de-risks agriculture. As we define the role of technology in realising this vision, it is useful to \noutline the specific outcomes we seek for farmers by 2035 (a mid-term milestone) and 2047 (the \ncentenary of Independence). Broadly, to achieve an increase in farmer incomes, the agricultural \nsector must prioritise improving farm productivity and diversification, strengthening post-harvest \nmanagement and value chain addition, enhancing market linkages, and promoting sustainable, \nclimate-resilient practices.\nKey Viksit Bharat Indicators\nImprove productivity \n(Annual yield in MT)\nOptimize overall N:P:K \nratio (N:P2O5:K2O)    \nExpand area under \nirrigation\nImprove farm level \nmechanization\nReduce post harvest \nlosses incurred (in % GDP)\nIncrease share of \nHorticulture \n(% Agriculture GVA)\nIncrease \nprocessing level\nRestore degraded land \n(in Mha)\nPrioritised areas \nStrengthening \npost-harvest management \nand value addition\nEnhancing market linkages \n(domestic and export)\nPromoting sustainable, \nclimate-resilient practices\nImproving farm \nproductivity \nand diversiﬁcation\n316\n>380\n>550\n~15%\n<12%\n<5%\n7.7:3.1:1\n4:2:1\n4:2:1\n~33%\n~33%\n~35%\n~46%\n>50%\n>60%\nFoodgrain (%)\nHorticulture (%)\n>66%\n>75%\n>90%\n>3%\n>7%\n>20%\n40-45%\n>50%\n>75%\nN/A\n>26\n>49\n2025\n2030 Target\n2047 Target\nExhibit 2.3: Key indicators for achieving Viksit Bharat 2047\nThese priorities for 2035 and beyond represent the actions required to boost farmer incomes \nand sector growth.

To illustrate \nthis potential, envision a fully tech-integrated farm of the future in India in 2047\nExhibit 2.4: Resilient Farming Practices in a tech-enabled, mechanised, and digitally monitored \nfarm with multi-cropping in 2047\n20 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\n2.3 Gaps and Breakdowns in Technology Application  \nWhile the benefits of integrating frontier technology are well-known, it is important to recognise \nand address barriers across different farmer segments, stalling at one of three stages: adoption \n(market to farm), commercialisation (lab to market), and innovation (lab).  These challenges to \nscaling frontier technologies are summarised by archetypes in the table below: \nIncrease ADOPTION\nMARKET to FARM\nDrive COMMERCIALIZATION\nLAB to MARKET\nSupport INNOVATION\nLAB (invent)\nKey \nrequirement \nThree-pronged approach to drive agri transformation: Increase \nADOPTION, Drive COMMERCIALIZATION, Support INNOVATION\nAspiring\nTransitioning\nAdvanced\nWhat \nfarmers \nneed\nKey barriers \nto Frontier \ntech\nExhibit 2.5: Key barriers to frontier technology by different farmer archetypes\nIn short, an aspiring smallholder’s barriers (e.g., trust and affordability, last-mile support to explain, \nenable and operate technology) differ greatly from those of a transitioning farmer (e.g., low \ncontextualisation of solutions to agro-climatic zones and farm scale, lack of enabling phygital \ninfrastructure) and an advanced large farmer (e.g., regulatory or innovation hurdles). Accordingly, \nscaling frontier technologies in agriculture requires a tailored approach for each segment, boosting \nlast-mile adoption for aspiring farmers, enabling widespread commercialisation for transitioning \nfarmers, and supporting ongoing innovation for advanced farmers. For instance, consider the \nfollowing examples of frontier technologies and the structural barriers they face:  \nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 21 \nExample 1 | Low adoption of micro-irrigation by aspiring farmers owing to eco­\nnomic viability and low last-mile support\nLimited last mile \nadvisory and \nimplementation support\nLack of customized \nsolutions (e.g. – bundled \nofferings \nDrip and sprinkler systems\nexist and are available,\ndramatically improving\nwater-use efficiency\nIoT-based soil moisture \nsensors and automated \nirrigation triggers\nDigital monitoring and \nremote irrigation \nmanagement tools\nFragmentation reduces \nthe economic viability and \ncost effectiveness  \nLow trust - Concerns over \nmaintenance, durability, \nand risk of breakdowns; \nskepticism about digital \nscheduling tools\nBarriers to \nadoption\nStatus of \nsolutions existing\nTools for monitoring \nsoil moisture and \nautomating irrigation\nEfficient water use to \nsustain yields in \nwater-scarce conditions\nAffordable and reliable \nirrigation solutions that \nmaximize productivity\nFarmer needs\nExample 2 | Low contextualisation and commercialisation of automatic sorting \nand grading for transitioning farmers reduces viability\nLimited local data makes \nit hard to train models for \ncrop varieties \nLack of guidelines for \nsorting/ grading \nspeciﬁcations result in \nlow standardization and \nprice realization, limiting \nvalue proposition of tech\nLack of phygital \ninfrastructure like \ncollection centers, coupled \nwith electricity/ internet \nconnectivity limit adoption\nAutomatic grading \nenables traceability &",

Concerted efforts through \nthe Digital Agriculture Mission have laid strong groundwork for a modern agricultural ecosystem. \nYet, as agricultural practices and technologies advance rapidly, the system must evolve into its next \niteration and overcome the system roadblocks identified in section 3. This section recommends \nDigital Agriculture Mission 2.0., a comprehensive three-pillar approach that upgrades foundational \nsystems, builds domestic capacity for innovations, and fosters ecosystem convergence to translate \nthem into last mile impact.  \n Digital Agriculture Mission 2.0\nDATA\nPHYGITAL DIVIDE\nTRUST\nTALENT\nFRAGMENTATION\nCAPITAL\nCAPITAL\nRoadblocks addressed\nRoadblocks addressed\nRoadblocks addressed\nFRAGMENTATION\nCAPITAL\nTRUST\nResearch & talent ecosystems \nfor future-proof, globally \ncompetitive innovations\nREIMAGINE\nFoundational systems to make \nthem frontier-tech ready \nENHANCE\nPublic-private efforts to accelerate \nagricultural transformation\nCONVERGE\nEstablish network of \nfrontier technology \nCentres of Excellence\nInstitutionalise policy foresight \nunits and regulatory sandboxes\nTransition to a 360° \ndata ecosystem\nShift to mission-oriented, \ntranslational R&D\nDigitally enable the \nlast-mile ecosystem\nUpgrade agritech startup \naccelerator ecosystem\nCultivate interdisciplinary, \nindustry aligned talent\nExhibit 4.1: Three-Part Framework to Enable Scale-up of Frontier Technologies\n28 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\n4.1 Enhance foundational systems to be frontier-tech ready\nSeveral national missions and programs have established robust foundations for deploying and \ndelivering agritech solutions. However, as agricultural technologies mature, these foundational \nsystems remain underutilised. To unlock their full transformative potential, the first pillar recommends \nadvancing three critical enablers, as natural progressions of ongoing efforts under the Digital \nAgriculture Mission: a robust 360° data ecosystem, a digitally enabled last-mile network, and a \nstrengthened AgriTech startup accelerator ecosystem.  \nImperative 1: Transition to a 360-degree data ecosystem \nReal-time, reliable, and ready-to-use data for public and private entities to drive innovation, \ndelivery and decision-making \nUnder Digital Agriculture Mission 1.0, significant progress has already been made in building the \nfoundational data architecture. The AgriStack forms the backbone of this system by integrating \nthree core registries viz., farmer ID, geo-referenced village maps, and digital crop survey data, as \nthe identity layer to categorise and tag all other information and services. Alongside this, the Krishi \nDecision Support System (KDSS) adopts a whole-of-government approach to aggregating dynamic \ndatasets encompassing satellite imagery, weather, pricing, government schemes, and business \nintelligence tools to enable macro-level government planning and micro-level farm advisory. These \nservices converge at the Unified Farmer Service Interface (UFSI), which is intended as a common \naccess point for all public benefits and services, with the potential to include private sector offerings. \nImperatives for the system to progress to the next iteration \n1.\t\nTwo-way data exchange: Vast volumes of high-value data generated by the private sector \nremain untapped; enabling mechanisms and incentives can attract contributions from states, \nlocal agencies, and private entities to comprehensively capture ground realities. \n2.\t\nData quality and readiness for use: As agriculture is not a digital-native sector, manual \ndata collection methodologies lead to inconsistencies, gaps, and even obsolescence. Non-\nstandardised formats impede its use for innovation and service delivery. \n3.\t\nHigh degree of interoperability: Diverse data schemas stemming from the absence of \nharmonised data and metadata standards and collection protocols, hinder coordination; \nshared standards and governance are essential to scale a unified ecosystem. \nRecommendations to transition to the 360 Data Ecosystem (‘Agri Kosh’) \n1.\t\nAdopt a data mesh architecture: Enable decentralised data contribution with clearly \ndefined ownership by public and private entities, along with the responsibility to maintain \nand update the respective datasets. Existing cross-sectoral Digital Public Infrastructure \n(DPIs), such as AI Kosh, which already operate on such structures, may be leveraged for \nrapid deployment.  \na.\t\nAgricultural Landscape Map : Create a spatial grid of agricultural land for layering and \ncontextualising data (e.g. soil profile, water availability, cropping pattern, market and \ncredit access, last-mile network, value chain infrastructure) using GIS tools for data-\ndriven planning, convergence, and optimal resource allocation. \n2.\t\nEstablish an interministerial apex committee:  Oversee development, implementation, \nstakeholder coordination, and adoption of the data platform. The committee can be co-\nanchored by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry \nof Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (MoAFW). Proposed roles could include: \nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 29 \na.\t\nMeitY: Ensure data governance, covering security, privacy, data compliance, cost \nmanagement, and user access. \nb.\t MoAFW: Own the agri domain, harmonising data and meta data standards and sharing \nprotocols through consultations with NGOs, industry actors, technology experts, and \nstate government agencies.  \n3.\t\nEnsure open access with AI-enabled discovery and collaboration: Leverage AI-powered \nfeatures linked with DPIs that allow users to search and share curated AI-ready datasets \nand models, run comparative analytics, and engage through community features, thereby \nimproving data quality and fostering collaborative innovation. Launch structured outreach \nthrough innovation challenges, hackathons, and grants to promote real-world use cases, \nincentivising participation through increased visibility and mutually beneficial monetisation \nopportunities.\nStewards the data ecosystem, drives its \ndevelopment, implementation, adoption and \ncoordination across ministries, state governments \nand gov agencies\nApex interministerial committee\nGovernance structure\nPublic & private entities\nAre both contributors and consumers of data\nData \nProvisioners\nConsume\nData for \nresearch & \ninnovation\nAgriKosh\nIntegrate agricultural DPIs (AgriStack, VISTAAR etc.) \n& datasets to create \nThe potential of discovering mutually beneﬁcial partnerships, innovative use cases \nof existing datasets, and visibility in the ecosystem act as incentives for entities to share data\nUse-case driven approach  \nHackathons, grand \nchallenges to accelerate \ninnovation and research \nShare \nmodels \n& solutions \ntrained on \nopen \ndatasets\nOwn & \nMaintain \ndatasets:\nEnsuring data \nfreshness, \naccuracy, & \nreadiness for \nconsumption\nPublic: \nState & union \ngovernments\nIndustry: \nAgribusinesses, \nstartups, \nCivil Society: \nFPOs, NGOs, \nExtension workers\nAcademia: \nResearchers, \ninnovators, \nacademic \ninstitutions\nManages the IT architecture and \nenforces data quality standards, \ncompliance, privacy, security norms\nMinistry of Electronics and \nInformation Technology: \nIT Governance\nDeﬁnes data & metadata standards, \ncollection and sharing protocols, and \ninterrelations between datasets\nMinistry of Agriculture \nand Farmers' Welfare: \nDomain Owner\nTech architecture\nFeatures of data ecosystem to drive \nadoption and collaboration\nAI-ready \ndatasets, models \n& toolkits:  \nto promote AI \ninnovation",

While the configuration of this ecosystem varies substantially \nby region, depending on local institutional strengths and contexts, clearly defining the roles and \nstructure of the last-mile ecosystem is critical to ensuring that innovative solutions translate into \nimpact on ground. \nIn recent years, this last mile network has been significantly augmented through the development of \nVISTAAR, an AI-powered advisory Digital Public Good (DPG), the digital upskilling of local cadres \nthrough Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), and the computerisation of PACS \nand FPOs. With this as the foundation, initiatives like Apurva AI Chatbot (a peer-to-peer learning \nplatform) and Kisan Call Centres have been piloted.  \nImperatives for the system to progress to the next iteration: \n1.\t\nExpanded reach:  Despite a sizeable extension workforce, the ratio of extension officer \nto farms served remains significantly low at one extension officer for ~1100 farms, higher \nthan the recommended 7507. Geographic constraints further restrict reach. Thus, the system \nneeds additional virtual and direct touchpoints to supplement the existing field force and \nimprove access.  \n2.\t\nReal-time feedback and response loops:  There is a paucity of mechanisms that capture \nreal-time farmer feedback and track service outcomes. As a result, risk signals may \nbe missed, leading to a gap in receiving critical inputs required to refine services. Two-\nway communication channels are needed to make solutions responsive, accurate, and \npersonalised. \n3.\t\nBridging the digital literacy gap:  Low digital literacy amongst farmers precipitates the \nneed to develop interfaces that are intuitive, multilingual (trained in the local vernacular), \nmulti-format (voice, visual, text), and easy to access to encourage adoption. \n4.\t\nImproved accuracy of advisory:  Unreliable advisory can adversely impact farmer livelihoods, \nand thus, farmers exercise caution while adopting these services. High quality, hyperlocal AI \nmodels, trained on granular datasets and validated through field pilots, can build trust and \npower context-specific advisory and services.  \n7 \u0007Recommended extension functionary to farm ratios for irrigated regions in the Report of the Committee on Doubling \nFarmers’ Income, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (2017)\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 31 \nState Agri Services Registry Coordinate \nOutreach & Services\nMulti-Modal Channels for Direct Service \nDelivery (AI Chatbots, Kiosks)\nAI-enabled \nExtension \nCadres \n(ATMA, KVK \nScientists, \nKrishi Mitras \netc.)\nFPO agents, \nSHGs, youth \ntrained as \ntech \noperators \n(drone pilots, \nmechanics \netc.)\nLocal \nentrepreneurs\nSupports real-time two-way communication \nvia multi-lingual, multi-format capabilities \n(audiovisual formats, voice-to-text)\nUNIFIED FARMER INTERFACE\nOne-stop platform for farmers to access all \nagricultural services (advisory, ﬁnance, \nequipment rental, e-commerce) via \nmulti-modal channels  \nFeed \nreal-time \nﬁeld data \nto improve \nmodel \naccuracy\nPeer endorsements \n& feedback helps \nimprove services\nHyperlocal AI/ML models generate insights for farmers & extension agents\nYield \nprediction\nWeather Risk \nPrediction\nMarket \nAnalytics\nDisease & \nPest Mgmt. \nFarming \nTechniques & \nTechnologies\nFarmer Risk \nSegmenta-\ntion\nLocalized Public & Private Data Network powers solutions\nState-Agri \nUniversities\nAgriStack\nVISTAAR\nONDC\nAgriTech \nStartups\nFinancial \nInstitutions\nShares live plot-level data \n& feedback to reﬁne and \npersonalize solutions\nGains conﬁdence to adopt \nnew tech via accurate advisory \n& proactive services\nNon-exhaustive\nNon-exhaustive\nExhibit 4.3: Tech enabled multi-modal extension ecosystem with two-way communication\n32 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nRecommendations to modernise all elements of the extension network\n1.\t\nDeploy multi-modal, two-way delivery systems:  \na.\t\nIntegrated advisory channels:  Scale AI chatbots, IVR tools, call centres, and kiosks \ninto a unified multi-format, multilingual (vernacular) interface, enabling farmers to share \nreal-time inputs like crop images for diagnostics, advisory, and timely support.\nb.\t AI-enabled extension agents: Supplement AI efforts by equipping field agents with \nAI co-pilots for diagnostics, hyperlocal advisory, audiovisual demonstrations, and beat \nplanning for risk-based farm prioritisation, thereby enhancing the precision, efficiency \nand timeliness of outreach. \n2.\t\nDevelop hyperlocal AI models:  Partner with the private sector to develop and validate AI \nmodels tailored to cater to local agroclimatic conditions, crop profiles, farmer archetypes, \nand farm activities. Prioritise clusters high on data and digital readiness for initial pilots. \n3.\t\nBuild a trusted ground-level data network of public & private sources:  Curate hyperlocal, \nAI-ready datasets by leveraging data from private and public last-mile actors (FPOs, NGOs, \nSHGs), extension workers, and state agricultural universities, as these hyperlocal data sets \nare essential for training effective localised AI models.\nImperative 3: Upgrade the AgriTech Accelerator Ecosystem\nScale up innovations and deliver impact through outcomes-based investments\nIndia’s AgriTech ecosystem is flourishing, fuelled by a combination of public and private investments \nand over USD 2 billion in startup funding along with initiatives like RKVY-RAFTAAR and AgriSURE, \nwhich have incubated 1,900+ ventures through 29+ agribusiness incubators. Revamping this \naccelerator ecosystem is crucial to contextualise, scale and mainstream transformative solutions for \nagriculture’s evolving needs. \nSeveral frontier technologies developed today are capital-intensive and require long gestation \nperiods. Thus, there is a growing need for strategic partnerships, repeated capital infusion, structured \naccess to data, and robust R&D infrastructure and distribution channels for these ventures to scale \nsuccessfully and deliver tangible outcomes. \nImperatives for the system to progress to the next iteration:\n1.\t\nStrategic coordination:  A prerequisite for strengthening the AgriTech accelerator ecosystem \nis a mature, outcomes-focused framework for assessing its performance. Limited visibility \ninto investment outcomes hampers identifying underperforming segments, assessing the \neffectiveness of prioritised areas, and directing resources to areas of maximum impact.\n2.\t\nAccess to key enablers for scale:  Fragmented distribution channels, lack of granular regional \ndata, inadequate access to R&D infrastructure, and complex regulatory requirements inhibit \nstartups from scaling into new geographies.  \n3.\t\nPatient capital:  Current investments are primarily concentrated in lower-risk, high-volume, \nand fast-scaling segments whereas high-risk, frontier solutions witness limited activity. There \nis a pressing need to systematically diagnose the accelerator ecosystem, assess segmental \nneeds, and channel capital and institutional support to critical areas that will power the \nnation’s big leap toward 2047.  \nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 33 \nRecommendations to develop a post-acceleration ecosystem for AgriTechs\n1.\t\nSector mapping & outcomes assessment framework:  Develop a national framework to \nmap AgriTech accelerators and track their performance, diagnose ecosystem bottlenecks, \nidentify underperforming segments, and drive growth in priority sectors. Built in consultation \nwith private investors, accelerators, and state-level committees, the framework can also be \nused by AgriTech accelerators to realign targeted mandates that catalyse impact, drive \npriorities, and bridge gaps.\n2.\t\nNext-generation accelerator capabilities for the scale-up of support: Develop capabilities \nwithin the accelerator ecosystem through linkages with thematic Centres of Excellence \n(CoEs; details in section 4.3) to support a maturing AgriTech landscape as startups scale \ninto new regions and sectors.

To incentivise the infusion of patient \nand strategic capital, a joint corpus of private and public capital can be established. The \nintroduction of layered investment tools (debt, equity, concessional capital) and risk-sharing \nand financial incentives like first-loss default guarantees, grant matching, and tax credits can \nfurther encourage private sector contributions.\n4.2 Reimagine Agri-Innovations & Agri-Talent Systems for Future-readiness\nIndia’s Green Revolution, anchored by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), represents \none of the most transformative stories in agricultural development globally. As the scale, complexity \nand unpredictability of agricultural challenges increase, driven by climate stress, globalisation and \n34 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nmarket volatility, and shifting consumer demands, agriculture itself has become more knowledge \nand technology intensive to keep pace.\nIndia’s next agricultural transformation and the realisation of Viksit Bharat 2047 ambitions hinge \non its ability to fundamentally reimagine and revamp this institutional framework to unlock a \ncomparable technological revolution. There is an imminent need to revisit and reform existing \nsystems from a future readiness lens, ensuring that scientific advances and human capacity operate \nas twin engines of agricultural modernisation. Two foundational levers of this framework viz., the \ninnovations ecosystem and the talent pipeline, if strengthened and executed with intent, can drive \nfrontier breakthroughs in climate-smart, nutrient-rich agriculture, multiplying gains in productivity, \nresilience, and rural incomes while creating high-value agri-adjacent livelihoods. In the following \nsections, we identify priority dimensions within these levers that merit a re-examination.  \nImperative 1: Shift to mission-oriented, translational innovations systems \nA future-ready R&D ecosystem is envisioned as one that fosters and translates India’s scientific \ncapacity into scalable, globally relevant, and contextualised agricultural innovations that translate \ninto impactful solutions at the last mile. To enable this, four key dimensions merit reconfiguration:  \n• \nMission-oriented innovation systems: The siloed and discipline-specific nature of agricultural \nR&D and training limits the nation’s ability to address complex, interdisciplinary challenges \nsuch as climate resilience, protein security, or soil regeneration. A pivot to mission-based \nresearch portfolios that reorganise national research and innovation around clearly defined, \nhigh-impact problem statements is imperative. These portfolios can facilitate multi-\ninstitutional collaboration through shared mandates to innovate and tackle long-horizon \nchallenges, in line with national priorities, supported by reinvented academic institutions, \ncurricula, and pedagogy to facilitate this transition.  \n• \nTranslational pathways:  There is a need to reconfigure the R&D ecosystem as an \ninterconnected, translational research network integrating institutions such as innovation \nhubs, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to move innovations from labs to large-scale adoption \nwith speed and consistency. Mechanisms that embed field validations, market-readiness \ntesting, real-time farmer feedback, and market demand signals into the R&D lifecycle \ncan strengthen the feedback loop between research, regulation, and commercialisation, \nincreasing translational throughput of agri R&D, and generating robust datasets to mobilise \ninvestments and global partnerships.\n• \nPrivate sector investments: Agricultural R&D in India remains public sector-led and \nunderfunded, with public investment at just 0.6% of the agricultural budget versus \n0.9% globally and ~2% in leading economies, while private contributions remain meagre. \nReimagining funding through greater public spending in priority areas as well as robust \npublic-private collaboration coupled with strengthened IP enforcement, risk-sharing \nSeed technology has been recognised as a national priority through the National Mission on High \nYielding Seeds (FY25-26), given its outsized role in driving productivity, nutrition and resilience. \nSince 2014, ICAR and the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) have advanced from \ntraditional crossbreeding to hybridisation (6,100+ varieties), transgenics, biofortification (900+ \nvarieties), climate-resilient breeding (2,600+ varieties), speed breeding facilities, and seed \ncoatings/biological treatments. As of 2025, India has also launched its first National Speed \nBreeding Crop Facility in Mohali and developed CRISPR rice. Wider adoption of these technologies, \nalong with continued investment in R&D, will be essential for improved yield and productivity.  \nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 35 \nand blended finance to unlock private capital can accelerate innovation for and redefine \ntranslational pathways for scale-up in shorter timeframes. \nImperative 2: Cultivate interdisciplinary, industry-aligned talent system\nTo usher in a technological revolution, India requires a talent pyramid as dynamic as the \ntechnological landscape itself. Hence, the need to create inter-disciplinary talent pipelines through \nnext-generation AgriTech curricula and pedagogy, industry partnerships, and meaningful off-farm \nand post-production employment opportunities. In order to achieve this, a few key levers are: \n1.\t\nNational agri-talent framework: Agricultural transformation necessitates a talent shift \naligned with current and emerging market requirements. As the first step, there is a need \nto develop a comprehensive, National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)-aligned talent \nframework mapping the technical and sectoral skills and roles required across the agri-\ninnovations value chain with coherent career pathways enabling both vertical progression \nand lateral movement across four tiers: \no\t Academic and research talent (data scientists, agronomists, biotechnologists, AI \nspecialists etc.) to innovate solutions. \no\t Agribusiness leaders and entrepreneurs  trained in fields like sales and marketing, product \ndevelopment, procurement etc. through cross-disciplinary graduate programmes to \ndeploy innovative solutions.  \no\t Certified AgriTech service professionals (e.g., agri-logistics managers, drone pilots, IoT \nspecialists) to enable technology access and adoption at the last mile.\no\t Digitally literate farmers and producer groups equipped to absorb and monetise new \ntechnologies.\n2.\t\nIndustry-aligned academic and research ecosystems:  To cultivate talent, the agriculture \nuniversity network needs to embed industry more meaningfully. Centres of Excellence \n(section 4.3 for details) can facilitate private sector partnerships to co-design cross-\ndisciplinary curricula, co-deliver training programs, support farm innovation fellowships, live \nprojects, apprenticeships, and structured placement pathways to meet the evolving demand \nof employers and entrepreneurial systems. Concurrently, international collaborations and \nexchanges and mainstreaming of agricultural courses in prominent technology and business \ninstitutions can further develop a globally competitive domestic talent pool.  \n3.\t\nSkills ladder & certification for vertical mobility:  Skilling needs to shift to modular, stackable \nnano and micro-credentials that permit progressive learning, advanced specialisations, and \nbroad-based, customisable skill profiles. Combined with an NSQF-aligned certification \nframework that recognises prior learning to signal expertise to employers, such a system \ncould provide portability and diversified employment opportunities to rural populations \nacross geographies and sectors. \n4.\t\nMass entrepreneurship enablement:  Mass entrepreneurship across the agriculture value \nchain is a key unlock to enable technological solutions at the last mile, while generating \nemployment. Scaling public-private partnerships to deliver end-to-end support models \nlike ‘entrepreneurship-in-a-box’ that bring together capital, market linkages, mentorship \ndigital tools, and training tailored to producer organisations and rural enterprises, merit \nexploration to advance viable ventures at the last mile.  \n5.\t\nInclusion as a growth lever: Women and youth remain central to the future of the agricultural \n36 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\nworkforce. There is a need to identify targeted mechanisms to enable their participation \nin high-value roles, such as leadership in producer organisations, innovation challenges, \nspecialised training in agri-processing, and global exposure opportunities, to ensure frontier \ntechnologies are diffused to every beneficiary.  \nAgriculture’s R&D and talent ecosystem cuts across ministries (Agriculture, Skill Development & \nEntrepreneurship, Education, Rural Development, Biotechnology) and institutions. An exercise that \ninvolves redesigning curricula, funding flows, institutional structures, and skilling frameworks requires \ncontinuous consultations across stakeholders. Thus, to undertake this exercise, we recommend the \nestablishment of two time-bound thematic task forces, one focusing on the R&D ecosystem and \nthe other, on the agri-talent ecosystem. These task forces would bring together leading cross-\nsector experts with a mandate to define strategic priorities, draft 10–20-year roadmaps, develop \nmission blueprints and policy briefs, and recommend institutional reforms.\n4.3 Converge public-private efforts to accelerate agricultural transformation  \nThe transformation of Indian agriculture through frontier technologies cannot be driven by the \ngovernment or industry alone – it will emerge from the strength of their partnership. The scale, speed, \nand complexity of frontier-tech adoption in agriculture demand a new model of collaboration between \ngovernment, industry, academia, and innovators, one that unites public vision with private agility. \nWhile public institutions such as ICAR, State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), and government \nmissions bring reach, legitimacy, and long-term perspective, the private sector offers innovation \nvelocity, investment, and operational efficiency. However, these efforts often remain fragmented \n– research partnerships are ad hoc, data systems remain siloed, and regulatory alignment lags \ninnovation cycles. To overcome these gaps, India must institutionalise a mechanism that unites all \nrelevant stakeholders under a common framework for agricultural innovation and transformation.\nImperative 1: Establish a National Network of Frontier Technology Centres of Excellence for \nAgriculture \nThe answer lies in establishing a national network of frontier technology Centres of Excellence \n(CoEs) which will serve as the institutional backbone for structured private-public collaboration. \nTheir mandate would be to convene diverse stakeholders, startups, corporates, investors, research \ninstitutions, state agencies, and FPO networks, to co-develop, pilot, and scale frontier technologies \nacross the agricultural value chain. This network would serve as the nerve centre of India’s agricultural \ntransformation, where government priorities, private innovation, and farmer realities converge to \npower India’s journey toward Viksit Bharat 2047.\nTo translate this vision into practice, we propose:\n• \nInstitutional anchoring and governance: Joint stewardship of the network, anchored by \nrelevant ministries like the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (MoAFW) and \nthe NITI Aayog, with representation from key ministries like Ministry of Electronics and \nInformation Technology (MeitY), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), industry bodies8, \nand leading academic institutions. To de-risk innovations, ensure long-term continuity, and \nensure accountability across public, private and scientific partners, each CoE could adopt \nclearly defined partnership models and co-investment mechanisms.\n• \nThematic-focus: Each CoE can focus on a specific, high-impact problem statement such \n8 \u0007Some existing consortia to be considered include Federation of All India Distributors Association (FAIDA), Federation \nof Seed Industry of India (FSII), the National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), Small Farmers Agribusiness Con­\nsortium (SFAC).\t\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 37  \nas creating climate-smart seeds, precision agriculture for small-scale farming, developing \npost-harvest intelligence, and unlocking the full potential of agri data, insights and AI. \nThis shift from technology-focused or discipline-specific partnerships to mission-oriented, \nthematic CoEs reflects a recognition that agricultural transformation is a systems challenge. \nBy mobilising scientific, industrial, and civic capabilities around shared missions, such CoEs \ncreate the collaborative architecture needed to address complex, interdependent problems \nthat span ecosystems, markets, and communities, thereby enabling solutions that are both \nsystemic and scalable.\n• \nOutcomes-orientation:  These COE can have clearly articulated 3–5-year goals, anchored \nin specific, quantifiable outcomes (e.g. productivity enhancement, resource use efficiency, \nincome growth etc.). To further ensure impact, this can be linked to competitive outcome-\nbased funding mechanisms that reward demonstrable field impact, technology adoption \nrates, and patent generation. \n• \nEcosystem alliances: The CoEs will function as translational engines, cohesively integrating \nresearch, enterprise, and field deployment. To this end, structured linkages with Agritech \nstartup accelerators and incubators to scale promising, mission-aligned solutions and \ncapacity-building pathways for talent through fellowships, internships, curricula design and \ninternational collaborations should be considered to strengthen and reorient the translational \ncapabilities of the ecosystem. \nImperative 2: Institutionalise policy foresight and regulatory sandboxes for AgriTech\nThe rapid evolution of frontier technologies will need continuous changes in governance, regulatory \nframeworks, and solution dissemination. To achieve this, we need a regulatory paradigm that is \nproactive, agile and anticipatory, balancing the safeguarding of public interest with efficient last \nmile technology transfer. To achieve this, we need a mechanism for continuous dialogue between \nthe public and private sector and propose two initiatives: \n• \nAgritech Policy Foresight Unit: To address this gap, a dedicated AgriTech Policy Foresight \nUnit can be established to systematically track scientific and technological frontiers, shifts \nin global regimes, and assess their socioeconomic and ethical implications to propose \nanticipatory and adaptive regulatory pathways in consultation with relevant ministries and \nstatutory bodies. \n• \nRegulatory Sandboxes: Complementing this, regulatory sandboxes could be operated jointly \nwith the line ministries and state governments to evaluate and test frontier technologies \nin controlled environments before wider deployment. These mechanisms would create a \nstructured interface between innovation and regulation, allowing policymakers to learn \nfrom empirical evidence, refine standards, and build confidence among farmers, investors, \nand innovators. In doing so, they would embed agility and foresight into India’s agricultural \ngovernance architecture, ensuring that regulation evolves in tandem with innovation.\nIn summary, the Enhance pillar strengthens foundational systems for development and delivery, \nReimagine charts the frontier of AgriTech possibilities, Converge ensures that both are synchronised, \nguided, and amplified through an institutionalised process of coordination and consensus-building \nacross the vibrant ecosystem. It paves the way for coherent policies, efficient resource utilisation, \nand an inclusive approach to addressing India’s agricultural challenges, ensuring that transformative \ntechnologies and ideas reach farmers and contribute to a resilient, prosperous sector.\n38 | Reimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation\n5. CALL TO ACTION\nA robust agricultural system is central to a nation’s sovereignty, ensuring the fundamental imperative \nof food security. India has largely fulfilled this goal, driven by the remarkable productivity gains of \nthe Green Revolution. Yet today, the sector stands at a critical inflexion point. Beyond food systems, \nIndia’s agriculture holds the promise of becoming a powerful engine of economic growth with a \nrapidly advancing bioeconomy sector, projected to reach USD 300 billion by 20309. \nIn this evolving context, it is clear that conventional approaches will no longer suffice. The pace \nof disruption demands bold thinking and novel instruments. Frontier technologies, spanning \ndigital, biological, mechanical, and material science innovations, are redefining what is possible in \nfarming and enabling a new era of agricultural transformation. These innovations offer pathways \nfor mitigation, resilience, and adaptation, and can position India as a global leader and partner of \nchoice in agricultural innovation.\nRealising this potential will require nothing short of a Frontier Technology Revolution, one that not \nonly enables greater application of these technologies to India’s unique agricultural challenges but \nalso adopts a structured, data-driven approach to scale them from the lab to the field, thereby \ncreating a paradigm shift from rural livelihoods to rural prosperity. \nThe way forward is not linear. India must invest along two parallel tracks in order to resolve immediate \nchallenges that constrain current productivity, income, and resilience, and build readiness for \nfuture breakthroughs so that when transformative technologies emerge, the system is primed for \nrapid adoption and scale. Both tracks are equally urgent. Focusing only on today’s issues risks \nstagnation. Focusing only on tomorrow leaves millions vulnerable in the present. \nThis report offers a framework for the ecosystem that will need to come together in order to deliver \non the three-pronged agenda of enhance, reimagine, and converge. \n• \nThe government needs to act as a facilitator and orchestrator, helping enhance foundational \ncapabilities by providing a stable and future-ready policy and regulatory environment, \nbuilding robust digital and physical infrastructure, improving data systems, and enabling \nlast-mile connectivity while also converging efforts across actors.\n• \nThe private sector can play the role of innovators and scalers, reimagining solutions that \nare not only advanced but also accessible, affordable, and farmer-friendly, converging with \nacademia and innovators, and scaling with agility, for population-scale impact. \n• \nThe academia and research institutions will act as knowledge anchors, shifting from siloed \nresearch to mission-driven portfolios that address long-horizon challenges, building the \ntalent pyramid, and serving as bridge that connects fundamental research with industry \napplications.\n• \nCivil society can serve as connectors and enablers, enhancing awareness and capacity, \nfacilitating feedback loops, and bridging the phygital divide by combing digital tools with \nphysical networks to reach even the most marginalised farmers.\nThe stakes are high. By 2047, India aspires to be a developed nation. Agriculture, employing nearly \nhalf the workforce and feeding 1.4 billion people, must be at the heart of this transformation. Frontier \ntechnologies provide the opportunity to leapfrog structural barriers and herald an era of a more \nresilient, productive, and global agricultural ecosystem in India.  \n9 India’s Bioeconomy to Touch $300 Billion by 2030, Says Dr. Jitendra Singh; PIB Press Release, August 2025\nReimagining Agriculture: A Roadmap for Frontier Technology Led Transformation | 39 \nAPPENDIX: CALCULATION OF AGRICULTURAL INCOMES\nAgricultural income estimates were derived from the Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural \nHouseholds (2018–19), isolating net receipts from crop production as the principal indicator of \nagricultural income.

Also, several \nmajor and minor irrigation projects have \nbeen \nimplemented. \nAn \nintegrated \nprogramme of agricultural development \nwas initiated in the early 1960s to \nimprove productivity and to benefit \nfarmers. Our scientists contributed by \ndeveloping high yielding varieties / \nhybrids of crops. These were introduced \nto farmers who, in turn, adopted the new \nseeds and technology. As a result, a \nmajor breakthrough in productivity and \nproduction occurred in wheat in the late \n1960s.  Moreover, the new strategy laid \nemphasis on greater cropping intensity.  \nSince then, the progress of agricultural \nproduction was steady and the growth \nrate in food production maintained a \nlevel above that of population growth. \nThis came to be known as the “Green \nRevolution Era” that resulted in a \nsituation \nof \nself \nsufficiency \nin \nfoodgrains.  This era was characterised \nby synergy among technology, services, \npublic \npolicy \nand \nfarmers’ \nentrepreneurship. However, during the \npast decade, the growth rate shows a \ndeclining \ntrend; \nproduction \nand \nproductivity \nhave \nremained \nalmost \nstagnant. \nA \nconsiderable \neffort, \ntherefore, is required to reverse the \ndeceleration and get agriculture moving \nforward once again. \n \n1.3  \nThe \nNational \nAgriculture \nPolicy \napproved by the Government of India  \nduring 2000, aimed to achieve annual \ngrowth of more than 4 per cent in the \nagriculture sector on a sustainable basis, \nthrough the efficient use of natural \nresources and combination of other \nmeasures. However, the annual growth \nrate achieved during the Tenth Five Year \nPlan (2002–03 to 2006–07) averaged \naround 2.3 per cent.

The decline in \nagricultural \ngrowth \ncoupled \nwith \ndeclining profitability in the agriculture \nsector, in the face of rapid growth of \nnon-farm sector, is one of the major \nconcerns. The declining profitability is \npartially due to fluctuating world prices \nof agricultural commodities and the \nefforts to keep the domestic prices low \nto protect consumers’ interest, which \nresulted in decline in the terms of trade \nfor the farm sector. This, coupled with \nthe stagnating and declining yield levels, \nresulted in low income to the farmers. \n \n1.4  \nAnother major problem confronting the \nrural \nareas \nin \ngeneral \nand \nfarm \nhouseholds in particular, is the lack of \nemployment opportunities.  Efforts are \nneeded to increase job opportunities in \nthe farm sector through increased \ninvestment \nin \nirrigation, \nwatershed \ndevelopment, wasteland development, \nland reclamation, etc. In addition, there \nhas to be a greater focus on the \naccelerated development of the rural \nnon-farm sector and development of \nclusters around towns/market centres.  A \ngrowing \nfarm \nsector, \nbetter \nrural \ninfrastructure and connectivity, skill \ndevelopment, adequate power supply \nand easy availability of credit would \nhelp in the creation of more employment \nopportunities in the rural non-farm \nsector and, in turn, enhance the income \nof farm households. \n \n1.5  \nIn view of the above, there is a need to \nfocus more on the economic well-being \nof the farmers, rather than just on \nproduction. Socio-economic well-being \nmust be a prime consideration of \nagricultural policy, besides production \nand growth. The aim of the Policy is, \ntherefore, to stimulate attitudes and \nactions which should result in assessing \nagricultural \nprogress \nin \nterms \nof \nimprovement in the income of farm \nfamilies, \nnot \nonly \nto \nmeet \ntheir \nconsumption requirements but also to \nenhance their capacity to invest in farm \nrelated activities. \n \n2.1  \nSeveral \nsignificant \ninitiatives \nhave \nalready been taken in recent years by the \ngovernment to reverse the downward \ntrend in agricultural production and to \nfind \nsustainable \nsolutions \nfor \nstrengthening the farmers’ livelihood \nand income. Some of these important  \ninitiatives include: (i) Bharat Nirman; \n(ii) \nNational \nRural \nEmployment \nGuarantee Programme; (iii) National \nHorticulture Mission; (iv) Expansion of \nInstitutional Credit to Farmers; (v) \nEstablishment of the National Bee \nBoard; \n(vi) \nEstablishment \nof \nthe \nNational Rainfed Area Authority; (vii) \nEstablishment of the National Fisheries \nDevelopment Board (NFDB); (viii)  \nWatershed Development and Micro \nIrrigation Programmes; (ix) Reforms in \nAgricultural \nMarketing \nand \nDevelopment of Market Infrastructure; \n(x) Revitalisation of  Cooperative \nSector; (xi) Agri-business Development \nthrough Venture Capital Participation by \nthe \nSmall \nFarmer \nAgri-business \nConsortium; (xii) Reform and Support \nfor Agriculture  Extension Services; \n(xiii) National Rural Health Mission; \n \n \n \n3\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nMAJOR POLICY GOALS \n(xiv) National Food Security Mission; \n(xv) Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana to \nincentivise the states to invest more in \nagriculture; (xvi) Integrated Food Law; \n(xvii) \nLegislative \nFramework \nfor \nWarehousing \nDevelopment \nand \nRegulation; (xviii) Protection of Plant \nVarieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPVFR) \nAct, 2001; (xix) National Bamboo \nMission \nand \n(xx) \nKnowledge \nConnectivity through Common Service \nCentres (CSC) and IT initiatives. \n3.1 \nThe major goals of the National Policy \nfor Farmers are: \n(i) \nTo improve economic viability of \nfarming by substantially increasing \nthe net income of farmers and to \nensure that agricultural progress is \nmeasured by advances made in \nthis income. \n(ii) \nTo protect and improve land, \nwater, bio-diversity and genetic \nresources essential for sustained \nincrease \nin \nthe \nproductivity, \nprofitability and stability of major \nfarming systems by creating an \neconomic stake in conservation. \n(iii) To \ndevelop \nsupport \nservices \nincluding provision for seeds, \nirrigation, power, machinery and \nimplements, fertilizers and credit \nat affordable prices in adequate",

The \nterm will also include tribal families / \npersons engaged in shifting cultivation \nand in the collection, use and sale of \nminor and non-timber forest produce. \n4.1 \nThe purpose of asset reforms is to ensure \nthat every farmer household in villages \npossesses \nand/or \nhas \naccess \nto \nproductive assets like land, livestock, \nfishpond, homestead farm and/or income \nthrough an enterprise and or market-\ndriven skills, so that the household \nincome is increased substantially on a \nsustainable basis.  This, in turn, would \nensure nutrition and livelihood security \nand \ntheir \neducation \nand \nhealth \nrequirements. \n \n4.2  \nLand \n \n4.2.1  Considering the skewed ownership of \nland, it is necessary to strengthen \nimplementation of laws relating to land \nreforms, with particular reference to \ntenancy laws, land leasing, distribution \nof ceiling surplus land and wasteland, \nproviding adequate access to common \nproperty and wasteland resources and \nthe consolidation of holdings.  Following \nthe conferment of land rights to women \nunder \nthe \nHindu \nSuccession \n(Amendment) Act, 2005, the provision \nof appropriate support services to \nwomen farmers has become urgent.  \nJoint pattas for both homestead and \nagricultural \nland \nare \nessential \nfor \nempowering women to access credit and \nother services. \n \n4.2.2  The Land Acquisition Act would be \nreviewed with particular reference to the \nassessment of compensation.  Prime \nfarmland \nmust \nbe \nconserved \nfor \nagriculture except under exceptional \ncircumstances, \nprovided \nthat \nthe \nagencies \nthat \nare \nprovided \nwith \nagricultural land for non-agricultural \nprojects should compensate for treatment \nand full development of equivalent \ndegraded \n/ \nwastelands \nelsewhere.  \nFurther, the commitment under the \nexisting re-settlement policy of the \nCentral / State governments would be \nfulfilled in letter and spirit.  For non-\nagricultural purposes, as far as possible, \nland with low biological potential for \nfarming \nwould \nbe \nearmarked \nand \n \n \n \n5\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nallocated. State governments would be \nadvised to earmark lands with low \nbiological potential such as uncultivable \nland, land affected by salinity, acidity, \netc., for non-agricultural development \nactivities, \nincluding \nindustrial \nand \nconstruction activities. \n \n4.3  \nWater \n \n4.3.1  Non-availability of timely and adequate \nwater for irrigation is now becoming a \nserious constraint in achieving higher \nproductivity and stability of farming in \nmany parts of the country. Therefore, \nassured irrigation is the need of the hour.  \nThough the total rainfall in our country \nis satisfactory, its distribution is highly \nskewed.  Therefore, rainwater harvesting \nand improving the efficiency of water-\nuse are important.  It has been assessed \nthat even a 10 per cent increase in the \npresent level of water-use efficiency in \nirrigation projects may help to provide \nlife-saving irrigation to crops in large \nareas. Water-use efficiency can be \nfurther enhanced by generating synergy \nwith seed varieties, nutrients (macro and \nmicro) and farm implements. The \nconcept of maximising yield and income \nper unit of water would be used in all \ncrop production programmes. Water \nusers’ associations would be encouraged \nto gain expertise in maximising the \nbenefits from the available water. \n \n4.3.2  The majority of farmers depend on \ngroundwater \nfor \nirrigation. \nThis \nresource, in which farmers may have \ninvested their hard-earned savings, is \nbeing depleted and the water table is \nreceeding fast. Therefore, rainwater \nharvesting and aquifer recharge would \nbe accorded priority for ensuring the \nstability and sustainability of water \nsupply. \nWater",

There is considerable scope \nfor improving the income of fishermen \nfamilies \non \nan \nenvironmentally \nsustainable \nbasis \nby \nencouraging \nscientific fish rearing, harvesting and \nprocessing.  In the area of public policy, \nthere is a need for well-planned aquarian \nreforms in order to provide landless \nlabour families access to village ponds \nand other water bodies in the public \ndomain for aquaculture. \n \n4.5.2  The NFDB has been established by the \nGovernment of India to bring major \nactivities \nrelating \nto \nfisheries \nand \naquaculture for focused attention and \nprofessional management. The guiding \nprinciples for the NFDB would be \necology, economics, gender equity, \nemployment generation and advising the \nstate governments to facilitate rational \nand equitable allocation of public water \nbodies and reservoirs for practising \nmodern aquaculture. \n \n4.5.3  Following steps will be taken to promote \nmodern aquaculture practices and value \naddition: \n(i) “Fish for All” training and capacity \nbuilding centres to impart training to \nfisher families and fisher-women in \nall aspects of the capture / culture / \nconsumption chain, quality literacy \nfor hygienic handling and other \naspects. \n(ii) Provision of small dredgers for \nensuring the efficiency of fish-\nlanding centres. \n(iii) Centralised services to support the \ndecentralised capture and culture \nfisheries sectors. \n(iv) Inland aquaculture, including the \nculture of ornamental fish and air-\nbreathing \nfish, \nby \nproviding \nnecessary space in ponds and \nreservoirs. \n(v) Artificial coral reefs to compensate \nfor the loss of natural coral reefs to \nrevive the fish catch. \n(vi) Raising \nbio-shields \ncomprising \nMangroves, Casuarina, Salicornia, \nAatriplex \nand \nother \nhalophytic \nplants, to safeguard the lives and \nlivelihoods of coastal fisher and \nfarm families in the event of \ncyclonic \nstorms \nand \nseawater \ninundation during calamities like \ntsunamis. \n \n4.5.4  A dynamic policy for the management \nand economic use of the Exclusive \nEconomic Zone (EEZ) for a variety of \neconomic activities, including fisheries, \nwill be evolved and put in place with the \nassistance of NFDB. \n \n4.6  \nBio-resources \n \n4.6.1  Bio-resources refer to the abundant \nwealth of flora and fauna, including soil \nmicro flora and micro fauna, which, after \nland and water, form the third important \nnatural resource available to farmers.  \nEfforts will be made to conserve as well \nas enhance these resources and to ensure \ntheir sustainable use with equitable \nsharing of benefits.  Two major \nlegislations—the Protection of Plant \n \n \n \n8\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nVarieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPVFR) \nAct, 2001 and the Biological Diversity \nAct, 2002—are in place to achieve some \nof the above aims. Implementation of \nthese Acts would be strengthened and \ndetailed guidelines would be developed \nin such a manner as to recognise the \nrights of farmers and the farming \ncommunity.  The National Gene and \nBiodiversity Fund would be used to \nrecognise and reward contributions of \nfarmers and to support revitalisation of \nin situ farm conservation traditions of \nsuch communities.  A beginning has \nalready been made by the government in \nestablishing the Plant Genome Saviour \nCommunity Recognition Award for \nfarmers. \n \n4.6.2  For conservation and development of \nbio-resources, the following would be \npromoted: \n(i) \nDocumentation \nof \ntraditional \nknowledge through community \nbio-diversity registers with the \ninvolvement of women, who hold \nmuch of this knowledge. \n(ii) \nSupport to tribal and rural people \nfor revitalising their in situ farm \nconservation traditions. \n(iii) Participatory breeding procedures \ninvolving \nscientists \nand \nlocal \nconservers \nfor \nimproving \nthe \nproductivity of land races. \n(iv) Genetic engineers working in \npublic institutions to perform the \nrole \nof \npre-breeding \ni.e., \ndevelopment of novel genetic \ncombinations \nfor \nimportant \nbiological and economic traits, \nsuch as resistance to biotic and \nabiotic stresses, in participatory \nbreeding \nprogrammes \nwith \nfarmers, \nto \nintegrate \ngenetic \nefficiency and genetic diversity in \nan effective manner. \n(v) \nGenetic \nhomogeneity \nenhances \ngenetic vulnerability to pests and \ndiseases. Therefore, pre-breeding \nand participatory breeding would \nbe integrated to help insulate small \nfarmers from the risks of pest and \ndisease epidemics. \n(vi) Launch of literacy movement on \ngenetic and legal aspects, in areas \nrich in agro-biodiversity such as \nthe North East, Western and \nEastern Ghats and the arid and \nsemi-arid zones. \n(vii) Genome clubs will be encouraged \nin rural schools and colleges for \nimparting an understanding of the \nimportance of genetic resource \nconservation. \n(viii) Literacy and awareness to help \ntribal and rural families understand \nthe provisions of the PPVFR Act \nand the Biological Diversity Act \nwith reference to their entitlements. \n(ix) Training \nof \nfarm \nand \ntribal \nfamilies in methods of preventing \ngene erosion. \n(x) \nConservation \nof \ncoastal \nbiodiversity, including coral reefs \nand sea grass beds and support to \ntraditional methods of conservation. \n(xi) Organise and support herbal bio-\nvalleys in the Western Ghats, \nEastern \nGhats, \nVindhyas \nand \nHimalayan \nregion \nfor \nthe \nconservation and sustainable use \nof medicinal plants.  In such bio-\nvalleys, farmers would be assisted \nthrough venture capital and other \nsupport to take to conservation, \nselection and multiplication of \nmedicinal plants of value to health \nsecurity. \n \n \n \n9\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nSUPPORT SERVICES \n(xii) A nationwide programme will be \ntaken up for the ex situ and in situ \nconservation \nof \nplant \ngenetic \nresources at the field / farmer \nlevel. Farmer-level gene / seed \nbanks would be set up in areas \nwhere traditional varieties are in \ndanger \nof \nextinction. \n \nSeed \nexchange programmes undertaken \nby some state governments, should \ntake due care to ensure that the \ntraditional rice gene pool is not \nlost in this process. \n(xiii) Participatory \nmanagement \nof \nnational parks, bio-sphere reserves \nand gene sanctuaries. \n \n4.7  \nAnimal Genetic Resources \n \n4.7.1 A system of rewards and incentives will \nbe developed to enable and motivate \npeople to conserve their breeds under the \nBiological \nDiversity \nAct. \nThe \nBiodiversity Fund would be used for \nsuch purposes.  Livestock keepers’ \ninherent rights to continue to use and \ndevelop their own breeding stock and \nbreeding practises will be acknowledged \nand encouraged. The government will \nrecognise these rights, acknowledge \nlivestock keepers’ contribution to the \nnational economy, and adapt its policies \nand legal frameworks accordingly so as \nto protect the same and to pre-empt \nattempts to use the intellectual property \nsystem to obtain control over animal \nresources. \n4.7.2  Apart from conserving genetic diversity \nand acknowledging the vital role of \nlivestock keepers, there is a need to \ndocument the indigenous knowledge of \npastoral \ncommunities \nabout \nanimal \nmaintenance and breeding. Community-\nbased conservation and development of \nindigenous livestock breeds and species \nwill be encouraged, with a special focus \non both hot and cold arid and semi-arid \nareas \nwhere \ngenetic \ndiversity \nand \nassociated indigenous knowledge are \nparticularly well developed. State farms \nmay be used to promote in situ \nconservation of animal breeds.  Grazing \nlands must be earmarked to enable the \nconservation of animal genetic resources. \nDocumentation of special biological and \neconomic traits would be done in the \ncontext of the new biological and \nnutritional needs or for other economic \ntraits like hide/leather quality. Creation of \ndisease-secure facilities for screening of \ngerm plasm and selection of disease \nresistant varieties would be promoted. \n \n4.7.3 Indian breeds of cattle and buffaloes are \nin demand in other countries. Animal \nscience \ngraduates, \nself-help \ngroups \n(SHGs) and progressive livestock farmers \nwould be encouraged and supported to \nmaintain pedigree animals of these breeds \nfor \nexploiting \nexport \nopportunities. \nHowever, export of all biological material \nincluding \nanimals \nwould \nbe \nin \naccordance with the provisions of the \nBiological Diversity Act. \n5.1  \nScience and Technology \n \n5.1.1  Science and technology are the key \ndrivers of change in farm operations \nand output.  New technologies which \ncan help enhance productivity per unit \nof land and water are needed for \novercoming the prevailing technology \nfatigue.  Frontier technologies like bio-\ntechnology, ICT, renewable energy \n \n \n \n10\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \ntechnologies, space applications and \nnano-technology provide opportunities \nfor \nlaunching \nan \n“Evergreen \nRevolution” \ncapable \nof \nimproving \nproductivity on a sustainable basis.  In \norder to ensure social inclusion in \naccess to new technologies, public \ninvestment \nin \nsocially \nrelevant \nagricultural research should be stepped \nup under the umbrella of the National \nAgricultural Research System (NARS) \ncomprising large numbers of Indian \nCouncil \nof \nAgricultural \nResearch \n(ICAR) institutions, state agricultural \nuniversities, \nall-India \ncoordinated \nresearch projects and national bureaus.  \nNon-governmental \norganisations \n(NGO) and private sector research and \ndevelopment (R&D) institutions would \nalso be included under the NARS \numbrella. NARS would be restructured \nso \nas \nto \neffectively \naddress \nthe \nproblems faced by small and marginal \nfarmers. \n \n5.1.2  The research strategy should be pro-\nnature, pro-small farmer and gender \nsensitive.  Community-managed seed \nvillages and seed technology training \ncentres are needed, with women playing \nthe \nmajor \nrole \nbecause \nof \ntheir \ntraditional knowledge of seeds and seed \nmanagement, \nespecially \nin \ntribal \ncommunities. Scientific literacy and \nremoval of doubts and fears about the \nrisks and benefits associated with bio-\ntechnology and other new technologies, \ncan \nbe \nachieved \nthrough \nfarmers \nselected in each panchayat and provided \nwith adequate training, so as to enable \nthem to serve as farm science managers \nin their respective villages. \n \n5.1.3  A National Bio-technology Regulatory \nAuthority would be set up for ensuring \nthe \nsafe \nand \nresponsible \nuse \nof \nrecombinant DNA technology or genetic \nengineering. \n \n5.1.4  Need-based breeding of crop varieties \nwould be stepped up such as processing",

In all cases of health and \nfood security, social inclusion will be the \nguiding factor. \n \n5.1.8  Conservation farming would be given \npriority in the heartland of the Green \nRevolution and turning the Indo-\nGangetic Plains into a major food \nbasket through an appropriate mix of \ntechnology \nservices \nand \npublic \npolicies. \n \n \n \n11\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n5.2  \nAgricultural Bio-security \n \n5.2.1  Agricultural bio-security covering crops, \ntrees and farm and aquatic animals is of \ngreat importance since it relates to both \nthe work and income security of a \nmajority of the population and the food \nand trade security of the nation. An \nintegrated \nNational \nAgricultural \nBiosecurity System (NABS) covering \ncrops, \nanimal \nhusbandry, \nfisheries, \nforestry \nand \nagriculturally \nrelevant \nmicro-organisms will be established with \nthe following objectives: \n(i) Safeguard \nthe \nincome \nand \nlivelihood \nsecurity \nof \nfarmer \nfamilies, as well as the food, health \nand trade security of the nation, \nthrough effective and integrated \nsurveillance, vigilance, prevention, \nand control mechanisms designed to \nprotect the productivity and safety \nof crops, farm animals, fishes and \nforest trees. \n(ii) Enhance national and local capacity \nin initiating proactive measures in \nmonitoring, \nearly \nwarning, \neducation, research, control and \ninternational cooperation. \n(iii) Introduce an integrated bio-security \npackage \ncomprising \nregulatory \nmeasures, \neducation, \nimproved \nsanitary \nand \nphyto-sanitary \nmeasures and social mobilisation. \n(iv) Organise \nan \nintegrated \nnational \nagricultural biosecurity programme on \na hub-and-spoke model, with effective \nhome and regional quarantine facilities \ncapable of insulating the major agro-\necological and farming system zones \nof the country from invasive alien \nspecies of pests, pathogens and weeds \nas well as from the introduction and \nrelease \nof \nGenetically \nModified \nOrganisms (GMOs). \n5.3  \nAgro-meteorology \n \n5.3.1  The nation has considerable capacity in \nshort, medium and long range weather \nforecasting. Generic information about \nweather has to be translated into \nlocation- specific land-use advice, based \non \ncropping \npatterns \nand \nwater \navailability. The \nagro-meteorological \nadvisories issued from time to time, \nwould be used by Panchayat-level  \nfunctionaries, trained to give appropriate \nland-use suggestions to farmers with the \nleast possible time lag. For marine \nfisheries, data on wave heights and \nlocation of fish shoals available would \nbe \ntransmitted \nto \nthe \nfishermen. \nFrontline technologies such as internet-\nFM/HAM \nradio/cellphone \nservices \nwould be very helpful to fishermen in \nthis regard. \n \n5.4  \nClimate Change \n \n5.4.1  Climate change leading to adverse \nchanges in temperature, precipitation \nand sea level is an emerging issue.  Most \nexperts agree that the impact of global \nwarming has been in a worrisome \nmeasure, as evident from the melting of \nglaciers and Antarctic and Arctic ice \ncaps.  Coastal storms and cyclones are \nalso \nincreasing \nin \nfrequency \nand \nintensity. Consequent to these changes, \ndroughts and floods are likely to be more \nfrequent.  Although climate change is a \nproduct of unsustainable consumption of \nnon-renewable forms of energy, the \nharmful impact of climate change will be \nfelt more by those nations with limited \nresources \nand \ncoping \ncapacity.  \nProactive \nmeasures \nto \nreduce \nthe \nvulnerability to climate change will be \ntaken.  Based on simulation models, \ncontingency plans and alternative land-\n \n \n \n12\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nuse and water-use strategies will be \ndeveloped for each major agro-climatic \nzone. In drought and flood-prone areas, \nexperienced farmers would be trained as \n“Climate Managers” in the art of \nmanaging drought, flood and aberrant \nmonsoons. \n \n5.5  \nInputs and Services \n \n(i) \nSeeds: Good quality seeds and \ndisease-free \nplanting \nmaterial, \nincluding \nin-vitro \ncultured \npropagules, are essential for crop \nproductivity and security. Hybrids \nare now becoming available for \nmany crops. In the case of new \nvarieties, foundation seeds would \nbe provided to grass root level \nseed growers and their groups such \nas cooperative societies and SHGs. \nMutually beneficial farmer-seed \ncompany partnerships will be \nencouraged. \nAgricultural \nuniversities would be encouraged \nto organise courses on seed \ntechnology \nand business, and \nmainstream business principles in \nall applied courses. A national \nseed grid will be established to \nensure supply of seeds across the \ncountry, as per the area specific \nrequirement. \n(ii) \nSoil \nHealth: \nSoil \nhealth \nenhancement holds the key to \nraising farm productivity.  Steps \nwould be taken to ensure that each \nfarmer is issued with a soil health \npassbook \ncontaining \nintegrated \ninformation \non \nthe \nphysics, \nchemistry and microbiology of \nfarm soils with corresponding \nadvisories. More laboratories to \ndetect \nspecific \nmicronutrient \ndeficiencies \nin soils will \nbe \nestablished for this purpose. Soil \norganic matter would be increased \nby incorporating crop residues in \nthe soil. Proper technical advice on \nthe reclamation of wastelands and \non improving their biological \npotential will be made available.  \nFertilizer pricing policies will be \nreviewed to promote balanced use \nof fertilizers. Agro-forestry will be \nencouraged for efficient nutrient \ncycling, nitrogen fixation, organic \nmatter addition and for improving \ndrainage. Appropriate production \nand marketing mechanisms for \nbio-fertilizers, organic manures \netc. will be put in place to promote \ntheir \nuse \nfor \nimproving/ \nmaintaining soil health. \n(iii) Pesticides: The triple alliance of \npests, pathogens and weeds is the \ncause of substantial crop losses \nevery year.  The development, \nintroduction \nand \ndiffusion \nof \nenvironmentally safe and effective \npesticides will be given priority.  \nThere is a need for incorporating \nthe use of chemical pesticides in \nan Integrated Pest Management \n(IPM) system.  Suitable quality \ncontrol, safety evaluation and \nother regulatory systems would be \nstrengthened.  The sale of spurious \nand substandard pesticides would \nbe prevented and bio-pesticides \nwould be promoted. \n(iv) Implements: Farmers need region \nand crop specific machines and \nimplements for timely sowing, \nmanagement \nof \nweeds \nand \nimproving \ntheir \npost-harvest \noperations. \nWomen \nespecially \nneed woman-friendly implements / \ntools which can reduce drudgery, \nsave time, enhance output and can \n \n \n \n13\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nbe handled comfortably.  Agri - \nentrepreneurs \nincluding \nfarm \ngraduates and progressive farmers \nwould be encouraged to provide \nimplements and tools, machinery, \ntractors and other farm implements \non a custom-hire basis. \n(v) \nVaccines and Sero-diagnostics: \nMajor gaps in the presently \navailable facilities would be filled \nin the case of important animal \ndiseases. Bio-technology research \nin the area of vaccine development \nwould be stepped up, encouraging \npublic private partnerships. \n(vi) Fish Seed and Feed: Good quality \nand disease-free fish seed holds \nthe key to successful inland \naquaculture. Progressive fishermen \nand their groups such as SHGs \nwould be trained in induced fish \nseed breeding, production and \navailability of seed and fish seed \nfeed at affordable prices, with \nappropriate technical assistance \nfrom \nthe \nNFDB \nand \nother \nagencies. \n(vii) Animal \nFeed: \nInadequate \nnutrition is the primary cause of \nlow milk yield in dairy animals. \nBoth \nconventional \nand \nnon-\nconventional \napproaches \nfor \nconversion of cellulosic wastes \ninto good animal feed through \nappropriate \ntreatment \nand \nenrichment, planting of nutrition \nrich \nfodder \nplants \nand \ndissemination \nof \ntechnologies \nwould be encouraged. \n(viii) Other essential support services: \nThese include establishing genetic \nevaluation systems for indigenous \nbreeds as well as crosses, so that \nselection can lead to genetic \nimprovement \nof \nproduction \ncharacteristics; upgrading of breed \nthrough \nartificial \ninsemination; \ncross- breeding suited to the \nfarmers’ resources; and improved \nprocessing and marketing.   The \nlivestock sector has to become \nsanitary \nand \nphyto-sanitary \ncompliant. A cadre of para-\nveterinarians would be trained to \nset up support service centres for \nthe farmers, to promote early \ndetection and treatment of diseases \nand other veterinary services. \n(ix) Support Services for Women \nEmpowerment: \nFor \ncapacity \nbuilding and     livelihood, women \nworking \nin \nthe \nfarms \nneed \nappropriate support services like \ncrèches, \nchild \ncare \ncentres, \nnutrition, health and training, etc. \nFor \nfunding \nsuch \nactivities, \nexisting schemes of the Ministry \nof Panchayati Raj, the Ministry of \nRural \nDevelopment \nand \nthe \nMinistry of Agriculture would be \naugmented and utilised and new \nschemes would be introduced, if \nrequired. \n \n5.6  \nCredit and Insurance \n \n5.6.1 Improvement in the outreach and \nefficiency of the rural banking system \nis the need of the hour. Towards this \nend, the financial services would be \ngalvanised for timely, adequate and \neasy reach to the farmers at reasonable \ninterest rates. The banking system \nwould endeavour to meet the large \ncredit \npotential \nneeded \nto \nraise \nagriculture to higher thresholds and \nfor the growth of rural and agri-\nbusiness enterprises and employment, \nand would take steps to achieve \nfinancial inclusion. \n \n \n \n14\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n5.6.2 The Government of India has already put \nin place an agriculture credit policy to \nimprove access of farmers to institutional \ncredit. Steps would be taken for extensive \ncoverage of farmers under the Kisan \nCredit Card Scheme. Micro credit and \nmicro insurance will be promoted as an \neffective tool for encouraging production \nand reducing risk. Credit cooperatives \nhave an important position and role in the \nrural financial system and priority would \nbe given to reforms and revamping of \ncooperative credit institutions as per the \nrecommendations of the Vaidyanathan \nCommittee. Credit counselling centres \nwould be established where severely \nindebted farmers can be provided a debt \nrescue package/ rescheduling to save \nthem from a debt trap. National Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development \n(NABARD), as the leader of agriculture \nand \nrural \ncredit, \nshould \nfacilitate \nconvergence between credit availability \nand credit absorptive capacity of the \nfarmers and other rural borrowers and an \nefficient \ncredit \ndelivery \nsystem.  \nNABARD should actively involve itself \nin institution building and provide backup \nsupport \nthrough \nresearch \nand \ndevelopment \ninitiatives. \nNABARD \nshould function like a national bank for \nfarmers. \n \n5.6.3  Since agriculture is a high-risk economic \nactivity, \nfarmers \nneed \nuser-friendly \ninsurance \ninstruments \ncovering \nproduction, right from sowing to post-\nharvest operations. The insurance should \nalso cover the market risks for all crops, \nin order to insulate the farmers from \nfinancial distress and in the process \nmake agriculture financially viable. \nSteps would be taken to revamp the \nNational Agricultural Insurance Scheme \nto make it more farmer friendly. \n5.6.4  There is also a need for credit and \ninsurance literacy in villages. Gyan \nChaupals (village knowledge centres) \ncan help in this task. Awareness on \ncredit and insurance issues among \nfarmers would be promoted. \n \n5.6.5  Women need special attention in credit \naccess because of their lack of land \ntitle/collateral.  Kisan credit cards would \nbe issued to women speedily with joint \npattas for homestead / agricultural land. \nFor the cases without joint pattas, \nindemnity bonds / guarantees from \nhusband, \nand \nrelatives \nwould \nbe \nconsidered by the banks for extending \ncredit and kisan credit cards to the \nwomen farmers. \n \n5.7  \nCooperatives \n \n5.7.1  Cooperatives have an important role to \nplay in banking, input supply, marketing, \nagro-processing \nand \nother \nagri-\nbusinesses to protect farmers from the \nvagaries of existing imperfections in the \nsupply of inputs, production, value \naddition and marketing.  Cooperatives \nshould function as economic enterprises \nand not as an extended arm of the state. \nThey \nrequire \nan \nentrepreneurial \napproach, competitive edge through \nsuitable enterprise focus and strategic \nalliances with private and public sector \nunits. Appropriate mechanisms would be \nput in place so that farmers have greater \ncontrol of the market channels and \nimprove profit opportunities through \ncooperatives and SHGs. \n \n5.7.2  With economic liberalisation and market \ncompetitiveness, \ncooperatives \nwould \nrequire much larger capital and other \nfinancial resources. Changes in the legal \nframework and regulatory system would \n \n \n \n15\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nhelp \ngain \ngreater \naccess \nto \ncapital/financial resources. The policy \nand legal framework under which \ncooperatives are functioning would be \nreviewed so as to create an enabling \nenvironment for them to attain autonomy \nand run their operations in a business - \nlike manner, subject to provisions of \nlaw. \nThe \nmanagement \nof \nthe \ncooperatives \nneeds \nto \nbe \nmade \nprofessionally competent, with clear \ndemarcation of functions of the elected \nmembers and the managers. The audit \nand accounting systems would be \nimproved and made transparent so as to \ngive greater confidence to all the \nmembers of cooperatives. \n \n5.8  \nExtension, Training and Knowledge \nConnectivity \n \n5.8.1  The gap between scientific know-how \nand field level do-how has been \nwidening in the recent years. This \nknowledge deficit would be overcome \nspeedily to enhance farm productivity \nand \nprofitability. \n \nKrishi \nVigyan \nKendras \n(KVKs) \nwould \ntake \nup \ntraining and lab-to-land demonstrations \nin the area of post-harvest technology, \nagro-processing and value addition to \nprimary products to provide skilled \njobs in villages.   State governments \nwould be supported for strengthening \nthe \nextension \nmachinery \nthrough \nretraining and retooling of existing \nextension personnel and for promoting \nfarmer to farmer learning by setting up \nfarm \nschools \nin \nthe \nfields \nof \noutstanding / progressive farmers. The \nfarm schools with linkages to KVKs \ncan \nspeed \nup \nthe \nprocess \nof \ntechnological upgradation of crop and \nanimal husbandry, fisheries and agro-\nforestry. Efforts will be made to bring \nfarmers, processors, retailers and other \nstakeholders \ntogether \nto \nsupport \nmodern \nagricultural \npractices. \nConvergence \nof \nextension \nefforts \nespecially at the district level and \nbelow would be ensured. \n \n5.8.2 The \npotential \nof \nICT \nwould \nbe \nharnessed \nby \nestablishing \nGyan \nChaupals in villages. Further, the \ncommon \nservice \ncentres \nof \nthe \nDepartment of Information Technology, \nGovernment of India and those set up \nby the state governments and private \ninitiative programmes will be evolved \nfor \ninclusive \nand \nbroad-based \ndevelopment.  Thus, the structure of the \nICT-based knowledge system would, \ninter alia, include setting up of such \nvillage centres.  Last-mile and last-\nperson connectivity would be facilitated \nwith the help of technologies such as \nbroadband internet, community radio, \nor internet-mobile phone synergies. \n \n5.8.3 Empowering farmers with the right \ninformation at the right time and place is \nessential for improving the efficiency \nand viability of small and marginal \nholdings. Mass media, particularly the \nradio, television and local language \nnewspapers, will be used to play an \nimportant role in this regard. \n \n5.9  \nSocial Security \n \nCoverage of farmers, particularly small \nand marginal farmers and landless \nagricultural \nworkers, \nunder \na \ncomprehensive national social security \nscheme \nis \nessential \nfor \nensuring \nlivelihood security.   The government \nwould, therefore, take necessary steps to \nput in place an appropriate social \nsecurity scheme. \n \n \n \n16\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n5.10  Agricultural Prices, Marketing and \nTrade \n \n5.10.1  Assured and remunerative marketing \nopportunities hold the key to continued \nprogress in enhancing farm productivity \nand profitability. Several significant \nmarket reforms have already been \ninitiated by the Central and the State \ngovernments. These reforms provide \nmore options to farmers for selling their \nproduce, allowing the private sector, \nincluding \ncooperatives, \nto \ndevelop \nmarkets, \npromote \ndirect \nsales \nto \nconsumers, processors and retail chain \nsuppliers / exporters and remove scope \nfor corruption and harassment.  The \nfollowing steps would be taken: \n(i) \nThe \nMinimum \nSupport \nPrice \n(MSP) \nmechanism \nwould \nbe \nimplemented effectively across the \ncountry. \n(ii) \nThe Market Intervention Scheme \n(MIS) would be strengthened to \nrespond speedily to exigencies \nespecially in the case of sensitive \ncrops in the rainfed areas. \n(iii) The establishment of community \nfoodgrains \nbanks \nwould \nbe \npromoted to help in the marketing \nof underutilised crops and thereby \ngenerate an economic stake in the \nconservation of agro-biodiversity. \n(iv) The food security basket will be \nenlarged by storing and selling \nnutritious millets such as bajra, \njowar and ragi and other crops \nthrough the network of the Public \nDistribution Systems (PDS). \n(v) \nEfforts will be made to develop a \nsingle national market by relaxing \ninternal restrictions. All controls \nand regulations hindering increase \nin \nfarmers’ \nincome \nwill \nbe \nreviewed and abolished. \n(vi) Terminal markets for agriculture \nwould be developed in public-\nprivate \npartnership \nmode \nto \nprovide better market access to \nfarmers \nwith \nbetter \nprice \nrealisation in a transparent trading \nenvironment \nwith \nsuitable \nbackward \nlinkages \nto \ngive \ntechnical backstopping services \nneeded for quality and demand \ndriven production. \n(vii) The \nrole \nof \nthe \nAgriculture \nProduce Market Committees and \nState \nAgriculture \nMarketing \nBoards would be transformed from \nmere \nregulatory \nfocus \nto \npromotion of grading, branding, \npackaging and development of \nmarkets for local produce. \n \n5.10.2  Farmers require authentic advice based \non \nmeteorological, \nmarketing \nand \nmanagement information for land-use \ndecisions and investments. Infrastructure \nsupport would be put in place to \nminimise post-harvest losses and enable \nagro-processing and value-addition at \nthe village level itself to increase \nemployment and income.  Farmers’ \norganisations and other entities like \ncooperatives and small farmers’ estates \nwould be encouraged so that farmers can \nget a fair deal and enjoy the economies \nof \nscale. \n \nProducer \ngroups \nand \ncooperatives will be encouraged to \npromote \nagro-processing \nindustry. \nConstraints would be removed for \nimproving \nthe \nnegotiability \nof \nwarehouse receipts. \n5.10.3  The trade policies in agriculture would \naim at protecting the livelihood of \nfarmer families and fostering their \neconomic \nwell-being. \nEffective \nlivelihood security for farmers would be \nput in place. Quality and trade literacy \n \n \n \n17\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \nprogrammes would be launched across \nthe country. Appropriate measures would \nbe introduced to mitigate price risks and \nenable the stakeholders, particularly the \nfarmers, to hedge their risk. \n \n5.10.4  Farmers’ associations and SHGs would \nbe supported to export on competitive \nterms by spreading awareness of the \nopportunities \navailable \nfor \nexternal \nagricultural trade and for value addition. \nThe agri-export zones would be further \nstrengthened to become places where \nfarmers will get the best possible price \nfor their produce. \n \n5.10.5  The twin goals of ensuring justice to \nfarmers in terms of a remunerative price \nfor their produce and to consumers in \nterms of a fair and affordable price for \nstaples (as farmers are also consumers) \nwould be achieved through the following \nintegrated strategy: \n(i) The \ngovernment, \nwhile \ntaking \ndecisions on MSP, would ensure that \nthe farmers’ interests in receiving \nremunerative prices for their produce \nare adequately safeguarded. \n(ii) Stable \nand \nefficient \nmarket \nenvironment, \nincluding \neffective \nimplementation of MSP in rainfed \nareas, \nwould \nadd \nto \nthe \nimprovement in productivity and \nincome in dry land farming. \n \n5.10.6  The terms of reference and status of the \nCommission for Agricultural Costs and \nPrices (CACP) would be reviewed to \nmake the MSP regime more effective. \n \n5.11  Integration with Processing and Value \nChain \n \n5.11.1 It is well recognised that value addition \nto agricultural produce increases income \nlevels of the farmers. Therefore, it is \nnecessary to integrate their production \nwith processing and other value chain \nactivities. However, the post-harvest \ninfrastructure in the country is grossly \ninadequate, \nresulting \nin \nhuge \ninefficiencies \nand \nwastages. \nThe \npercentage of post harvest losses at \nvarious stages of storage, grading, \npacking and marketing due to improper \nhandling \nand \ntransportation, \nvary \ngreatly, depending on the nature of crop \nand climatic conditions. The food \nprocessing industry has the potential to \nprovide \nlong-term \neconomic \nsustainability to the farmers by adding \nvalue to their produce, improving post-\nharvest management linking the farmers \nto the market and promoting demand-\ndriven farming.  Further, the food \nprocessing \nactivities \nalso \nneed \nmodernisation. Hence, effective steps \nwould be taken to facilitate and stimulate \nthis \nprocess, \nmodernise \nthe \nfood \nprocessing sector and enhance its \ncompetitiveness. \n \n5.12  Curriculum Reform \n \n5.12.1  Agricultural \n/ \nAnimal \nSciences \nUniversities: \nThe \nmotto \nof \nthese \nuniversities would be to groom “every \nscholar/student as an entrepreneur”. This \nwill \ncall \nfor \nintegrating \nbusiness \nmanagement \nprinciples \nwith \nmajor \napplied courses. The agriculture/farm \nuniversities would also restructure their \ncurricula in a manner that the gender \nroles in farming are recognised and they \nare equally empowered technologically. \nThere is a need to restructure the \ncurricula to focus on nutrition, post-\nharvest technology, quality and safety \nstandards. The farm universities would \nbe reoriented to give emphasis on \n \n \n \n18\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \nSPECIAL CATEGORIES OF FARMERS \nentrepreneurship and capacity building \non quality including sanitary and phyto-\nsanitary \nmeasures \nand \nCodex \nAlimentarius standards of food safety. \n \n5.12.2  The mandate of the ICAR would be \nexpanded to provide for registration and \naccreditation to the farm graduates as \nregistered farm practitioners to provide",

Taking \ninto account the new opportunities \nopened \nup \nby \nICT, \npedagogic \nmethodology for promoting a learning \nrevolution among students would be \nadopted. University centres would also \nestablish \nemployment \nand \nbusiness \nadvisory services and promotion centres \nand special one-stop windows for \ngenerating \nawareness \nof \nself-\nemployment opportunities. \n6.1  \nTribal Farmers \n \nTribal farmers are among the most \ndisadvantaged category of farmers. A \nmajority of tribal communities across the \ncountry are dependent on forests and \nanimal husbandry for their livelihoods. \nThese \ninclude \ncultivation \n(shifting \ncultivation in many cases), collection of \nfuel, fodder and a range of non-timber \nforest \nproduce. \nUplifting \nof \ntheir \neconomic conditions would be a priority \nfor the government. For this purpose, the \nfollowing actions would be initiated: \n(i) Updating land records in areas \ninhabited by tribal farmers. \n(ii) Strengthening the institutional structure \nto enable a more participatory process \nin decision making. \n(iii) Easy access to institutional credit to \nall tribal farmers and adequate \nprovision of kisan credit cards for \nthem. \n(iv) Documentation of the traditional \ncrops and knowledge of the tribal \nfarmers and creating an economic \nstake in conservation of such crops. \n(v) Provision of appropriate technology \nand extension services and relaxed \ncriteria for providing inputs such as \nwater, fertilizers, seeds, etc. for \ntribal areas. \n \n6.2  \nPastoralists \n \nThe following steps would be initiated to \nensure better livelihood opportunities for  \npastoralists: \n(i) Restoration of traditional grazing \nrights and camping rights in respect \nof forest areas and in those areas \nearmarked for grazing purpose in \nvillage common lands. \n(ii) Formalising entitlements (including \nissue of permanent grazing cards) \nfor traditional pastoralists/herders \nmaintaining native animal breeds to \nenable free access to notified or \ndemarcated \ngrazing \nsites \nand \nmigration routes. \n(iii) Grazing land and drinking water \nsources \nfor \nlivestock \nwill \nbe \nconserved and expanded to the \nextent feasible. \n \n \n \n19\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nSPECIAL CATEGORIES OF FARMING \n(iv) In-depth \ndocumentation \nand \ncharacterisation \nof \nindigenous \nlivestock breeds and preservation \nthereof would be carried out to \nrecognise \nand \nprotect \nthe \nintellectual property rights of the \nlocal communities / individuals \nconserving these livestock breeds. \n(v) Pastoralists would be involved in all \nlocal natural resource management \nprogrammes, \nincluding \nvillage \nforest committees and joint forest \nmanagement. \n \n6.3  \nOther Categories \n \n6.3.1  Besides the above two groups, there are \nseveral small groups with distinct and \nspecial needs such as small plantation \nfarmers, island farmers, urban farmers \nand organic farmers. \n \n6.3.2  Plantation Farmers \n \nA large number of small farmers are \nengaged in the cultivation of plantation \ncrops like tea, coffee, rubber, cardamom, \npepper and vanilla.  Price fluctuation and \ncompetition from products imported \nfrom abroad are among the major \nproblems facing them. Therefore, the \nPrice Stabilisation Fund for plantation \ncrops will help them to be insulated from \nthe vagaries of the market. \n \n6.3.3  Island Farmers \n \nThe farming and fisher families in the \nAndaman \nand \nNicobar \nIslands, \nLakshadweep group of islands and other \nislands need special attention including \ntechnology, \ntraining, \ntechno-\ninfrastructure \nand \ntrade. \nIsland \nagriculture also has the problem of \ntransport \ncosts, \nparticularly \nfor \nperishable commodities like fish which \nmay have to be sold in the mainland.  \nThe ancient tribes of the Andaman and \nNicobar Islands have rich traditional \nknowledge and wisdom.  Steps would be \ntaken to recognise and reward their \nindigenous knowledge in the areas of \nbiodiversity conservation and traditional \nhealthcare. \nHorticulture \ndevelopment \nprogrammes would be taken up in \nislands wherever feasible.  The creation \nof mangrove and non-mangrove based \nbioshields \nwould \nbe \ninitiated \nto \nsafeguard the lives and livelihoods of \nisland populations in the event of the rise \nof sea levels due to global warming and \ncalamities like tsunamis. \n \n6.3.4  Urban Farmers \n \nIn urban areas, home gardens and \nnurseries \nwould \nbe \nencouraged. \nNutrition gardens would be supported to \nsupplement the nutritional requirement. \n7.1  \nOrganic Farming \n \nThe organic farming movement in \nIndia suffers from a lack of adequate \ninstitutional support in the areas of \nresearch, extension, certification and \nmarketing \nand \nit \nrequires \nmore \nscientific \nsupport \nthan \nchemical \nfarming.

Unlike organic farming, \ngreen agriculture permits the safe and \nminimal use of mineral fertilizers and \nchemical pesticides, as well as crop \nvarieties \ndeveloped \nby \ngenetic \nmodification. \nGreen \nagriculture \nproducts would be encouraged with \ndistinct labelling and certification as \nin the case of organic farming. \n7.3  \nGenetically Modified (GM) Crops \n \nThere is a need to assess the risks and \nbenefits associated with GM crops in a \ncredible \nand \ntransparent \nmanner.   \nPriority would be given for genetic \nmodification to incorporate genes which \ncan help impart resistance to drought, \nsalinity and other stresses.  Water-use \nefficiency as well as improvement of \nboth nutritive and processing quality \nwould also be accorded priority in the \nresearch agenda.

Low-cost \ngreen houses, along with micro-\nirrigation and fertigation techniques, \nwould be popularised in areas where \nevaporation \nexceeds \nprecipitation \nduring several months in a year.  \nSuitable support would be given for \nsuch \ntechnologies \nthat \nwould \nincrease income in water deficit \nareas. \n \n \n \n \n \n21\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n \nFARMERS OF THE FUTURE \n \n \n8.1  \nDistress Hotspots \n \nSeveral steps have been taken by the \ngovernment to mitigate agrarian distress \nexperienced in some parts of the \ncountry. It is important that special \nattention is paid to such areas to reduce \nrisk and promote inputs for sustainable \nagricultural practices. In such areas, \nknowledge connectivity, social support \nsystems and marketing infrastructure \nwill be strengthened. Convergence of the \nbenefits under different schemes would \nalso be encouraged. \n8.2  \nMega Bio-diversity Areas \n \nLocal communities would be involved in \nthe conservation of mega bio-diversity \nareas such as Western and Eastern \nGhats, eastern Himalayan region, other \nNorth East and tribal areas. These \ncommunities \nwould \nbe \ngiven \nan \nincentive and their contributions would \nbe appropriately recognised.  Steps \nwould also be taken to enable local \ncommunities in mega bio-diversity areas \nto convert bio-resources into economic \nwealth in a sustainable manner. \n9.1  \nThe slow growth of opportunities in the \nnon-farm employment sector has led to \nthe \nproliferation \nof \ntiny \nand \neconomically \nnon-viable \nholdings.  \nIncrease in small farm productivity and \ncreating \nmultiple \nlivelihood \nopportunities \nthrough \ncrop-livestock \nintegrated farming systems as well as \nagro-processing would be supported for \nincreasing farmers’ incomes.  Methods \nof achieving economies of scale by small \nand marginal farmers through the \nfarming groups would be popularised to \nenhance yield and income.  Women \nwould be encouraged to participate in \nsuch group activities. The following are \nsome of the methods which may benefit \nthe small and marginal farmers for \ngaining efficiency and economies of \nscale in their farming operations. \n(i) Cooperative Farming and Service \nCooperatives: These have been \nsuccessful in the case of the dairy \nindustry.  Marketing cooperatives \nare \nsuccessful \nsince \nmembers \ncooperate \non \nthe \nbasis \nof \nenlightened self-interest.  Other \nforms of service cooperatives are \nslowly emerging, but the pace needs \nto be accelerated. Small farmers’ \ncooperatives would, therefore, be \nencouraged and supported to take up \nactivities such as processing, value \naddition and marketing of agro \nproducts. \n(ii) Group Farming by SHGs: SHGs \nfor \nsupporting \nmicro-enterprises \noperated by women with the help of \nmicro credit have been highly \nsuccessful. \nWith \nthe \ngrowing \ndiminution in the size of operational \nholdings, it will be useful to \npromote SHGs and commodity-\nbased farmers’ organisations at the \nproduction end of the farming \nenterprise by encouraging groups \nfor consolidating farming activities. \nThis will be particularly helpful in \nthe case of “Green Agriculture” \ninvolving \nintegrated \npest \nmanagement, \nintegrated \nnutrient \nsupply, scientific water management \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSPECIAL REGIONS \n \n \n \n22\nNational Policy for Farmers \n \n \n \n10  \n \n \n \nATTRACTING YOUTH \nand \nimproved \npost-harvest \ntechnology. SHGs would also be \npromoted for improving access to \ncredit. \n(iii) Small \nHolders’ \nEstates: \nThe \nformation of small holders’ estates, \nfor example, in cotton, horticulture, \nmedicinal \nplants, \npoultry \nand \naquaculture will help promote group \ncooperation among farmers living in \na village or watershed, or the \ncommand \nareas \nof \nirrigation \nprojects. Improving productivity, \nreducing the cost of production and \nentering into marketing contracts \nwith textile mills, food processing \nindustries, \npharmaceutical \ncompanies, \nand \nfish \nmarketing \nagencies will be some of the \nadvantages.

Appropriate market \nlinkages would also be provided so \nthat such efforts would improve \nemployment \nand \nincome \nopportunities in rural areas. \n(iii) Market \nIntervention \nScheme \nwould continue and would be \nstrengthened. Suitable measures \nwould be taken for expeditious \nprocessing and sanctions. \n(iv) A well-defined food security policy \nwith homegrown foodgrains is \nimportant \nfor \neradicating \nrural \npoverty and malnutrition.  In order \nto strengthen and regularly monitor \nfood security issues, the government \nwould \nconstitute \na \nCabinet \nCommittee on Food Security. \n(v) \nFarm families would also be \nprotected from becoming victims \nof HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis \n(TB). Anti-retroviral drugs would \nbe made available in villages free \nof cost.   The approach to the \ntreatment of farmers who are \nvictims of serious diseases like \nHIV/AIDS and TB in villages \nwould take into account access of \nthe patient to food and nutrition to \nassist recovery and restoration of \nproductive life. \n(vi) There is a need for a rural non-\nfarm employment initiative for \nfarm households.  The initiative \nwould bring all rural non-farm \nemployment programmes together \nin order to generate convergence \nand synergy among them. A \nconsortium approach involving the \ndifferent \nagencies \nconcerned \nwould be adopted. \n(vii) Along with production growth \nrates, income growth rates would \nalso be measured and published. \nImproving income and livelihood \nof farmers would be incorporated \nas a primary objective of all \nschemes \nimplemented \nin \nthe \nagriculture sector. \n(viii) Article 243 G of the Constitution \n(73rd Amendment) Act, 1982, \nentrusts \npanchayats \nwith \nthe \nresponsibility \nfor \nagriculture \nincluding agricultural extension.

As a major global cereal producer, \nIndia accounts for 11.6 per cent of the world's total output. However, crop yields in \nthe country are considerably lower compared to those of other leading producers, \nunderscoring the need for productivity improvements. The crop sector has experienced \na modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1 per cent, from FY13 to FY22. \nThis increase is also largely driven by notable increases in the production of fruits, \nvegetables, and pulses. \nBox IX. 1 :  India's Floriculture: A Sunrise Industry\nIndia's floriculture industry has grown into a high-performing sector, earning its status \nas a \"sunrise industry\" with a 100 per cent export orientation5. Driven by a growing \nglobal demand for flowers, floriculture has evolved into a key commercial venture within \nagriculture. Commercial floriculture is particularly lucrative, offering higher returns per \nunit area than many traditional field crops. Profitable avenues in commercial floriculture \ninclude cut-flower production, loose-flower production, dry flowers, cut greens, pot plants, \nflower seeds, perfumes and essential oils. Ramachandra et al. (2007)6  found that including \nflowers in rice-based crop sequences gave higher net returns than other sequences, viz. rice-\nsoybean, rice-bell pepper, rice-fodder maize, rice-cowpea and rice-radish. Further, inter-\ncropping flowers are more profitable compared to the options of cereals, pulses, vegetables \nand oilseeds. With subsidy support and crop loan financing, it is a promising venture for \nmarginal and small landholdings, which constitute more than 96 per cent of the total \nlandholdings and 63 per cent of the area of cultivation under floriculture.\nChart: IX.3 Distribution of \noperational landholdings under \nfloriculture\nChart: IX.4 Exports of agri-and \nprocessed foods (April-Oct FY25 \nover April-Oct FY25\n90.9%\n5.6%\n2.6%0.8% 0.1%\nMarginal\nSmall\nSemi medium\nMedium\nLarge\n14.55\n13.39\n7.17\n6.50\n3.77\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\nFloriculure\nProcessed fruits and\nVegetables\nLivestock\nOther processed food\nTotal\nper cent\nSource: Agriculture census, 2015-16\nSource: APEDA\n5 \thttps://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead_Products/Floriculture.htm.\n6 \tRamachandra C., Anwarulla M.

Entrepreneurs across states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya \nPradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have capitalized on this opportunity, \nestablishing sophisticated export-oriented floriculture units. In FY24, approximately 297 \nthousand hectares were dedicated to floriculture, yielding an estimated 2,284 thousand \ntonnes of loose flowers and 947 thousand tonnes of cut flowers. During the same period,\nIndia exported 19,678 metric tonnes of floriculture products, earning ₹717.83 crore (USD \n86.63 million). Key export destinations included the USA, Netherlands, UAE, UK, Canada, \nand Malaysia. With its high growth trajectory and promising export potential, India’s \nfloriculture industry is blooming as a vital player in the global flower trade7.\n9.6\t The slower growth rate of oilseeds at 1.9 per cent raises concerns, especially \nconsidering India’s heavy reliance on imports to satisfy domestic edible oil demands. \nHigh-value sectors such as horticulture, livestock, and fisheries have emerged as the \nprimary contributors to the overall growth of agriculture. Among these, the fishery \nsector has demonstrated the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at 13.67 \nper cent, followed by livestock with a CAGR of 12.99 per cent8 during FY15 to FY23(at \ncurrent prices).\nChart IX.5: International Comparison of Productivity for Selected Crops, 2022\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\nTotal Cereals\nTotal Pulses\nPaddy\nMaize\nSoyabean\nGroundnut\nkg/ha\nIndia\nWorld\nSource: Price Policy for Kharif Crops 2024-25, CACP\n9.7\t Diversity is also seen in inter-state variations in growth observed from 2011-12 to \n2020-21.

For example, Andhra \nPradesh diversified towards jowar, Madhya Pradesh towards moong and Tamil Nadu \ntowards maize. Even so, there is significant potential to enhance productivity and \nreduce the yield gap compared to the global average. \n9.8\t As we look to the future, it's important to consider how changing dietary \npreferences, driven by rising incomes, will influence the agricultural sector's growth \ntrajectory. The increasing consumption of non-food grains, particularly horticultural \nproducts, livestock, and fisheries, will be significant. Given the perishable nature \nof these high-value commodities, effective post-harvest management and robust \nmarketing infrastructure are essential. This endeavour should be supported by the \nactive involvement of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and Self-\nHelp Groups (SHGs). Furthermore, substantial investment from the private sector \nwould also be vital to aid small-scale farmers.\nBOX IX.2 : Transforming Rural Economies: The Rise of Horticulture\nIndia’s horticulture sector is more productive and profitable than traditional agriculture, \nemerging as a fast-growing industry. This can be seen from the fact that India is also a \nleading exporter, shipping 343,982.34 MT of fresh grapes worth ₹3,460.70 crore (USD \n417.07 million) globally in 2023-2410. Key grape-growing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, \nTamil Nadu, and Mizoram. Maharashtra leads in production, contributing over 67 per cent \nof total output with the highest productivity in 2023-2411. Grape cultivation has significantly \nimproved the livelihoods of Nashik farmers where export-quality grapes fetch higher prices \n(₹65-70/kg) than domestic markets. This economic upliftment has attracted rural youth \nto grape farming. Farmers have adopted advanced technologies like real-time monitoring \nsystems to ensure optimal grape quality.  The Nashik grape story shows how export-oriented \nagriculture, technology, and collective efforts can transform a region's socio-economic \nconditions.\n9.9\t The government is implementing a range of initiatives aimed at enhancing \nagricultural productivity and increasing farmers' incomes, in alignment with the \nrecommendations put forth in the Doubling Farmers' Income (DFI) Report  2016. This \nreport highlighted essential strategies for improving crop and livestock productivity, \nboosting cropping intensity, and diversifying into high-value crops. Committed to \npromoting greater input efficiency and adopting sustainable production practices, \nthe government is pursuing initiatives such as Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) and \nvarious actions under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). These \nmeasures include using alternative and organic fertilisers to enhance productivity \nand sustainability. Furthermore, digital initiatives like the Digital Agriculture Mission \nand the e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) have been launched to encourage \nthe adoption of innovative agricultural technologies and improve price discovery \nmechanisms. Additionally, the government provides income support to farmers \nthrough assured remunerative prices for their produce, alongside programs such as the \nPradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN).\n10   https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/six_head_product/Fresh_Fruits_Vegetables.htm\n11 Ibid.\nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n250\nCROP PRODUCTION: Incentivising productivity increase, crop \ndiversification and efficiency in the use of inputs\n9.10\t\t Despite the increase in crop production, further enhancements in productivity \nacross various crops and regions are vital for boosting performance and positively \ninfluencing farmers' incomes. Productivity is closely linked to on-farm and post-harvest \ninputs such as improved access to quality seeds, better irrigation facilities, efficient \nwater management practices, effective extension services, soil health improvements, \nmodern post-harvest infrastructure, and accessible markets. Additionally, agricultural \nprice policies play a crucial role in facilitating informed decision-making by protecting \nfarmers from market price volatility and encouraging them to diversify their crops, \npromoting sustainable agricultural practices.\nChart IX.6: Production of major kharif crops\nRice\nbajra\nRagi\nTur\nSoyabean\nUrad\nMoong\nMaize\nJowar\nlakh tonnes\n2023-24\n2024-25\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare\nNote: Production here is only for Kharif seasons for agriculture year 2023-24 and 2024-25\n9.11\t  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops such as wheat, rice, \npulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a \nguaranteed minimum price for their crops from the government. This mechanism also \nserves as a guiding signal for farmers in planning their future crop compositions. In the \nUnion Budget of 2018-19, the government decided the principle of fixing MSP at a level \nof at least 1.5 times the weighted average cost of production for these crops. The support \nprovides the necessary returns to promote sustainable farming practices and encourage \nfarmers to focus on cultivating key crops. The government has raised the MSP for nutri \ncereals (Shree Anna), pulses, and oilseeds as part of these initiatives. For the fiscal year \nFY25, the MSP for arhar and bajra has been increased by 59 per cent and 77 per cent over \nthe weighted average cost of production, respectively. Moreover, the MSP for Masur has \nrisen by 89 per cent, while rapeseed has seen an impressive increase of 98 per cent.\nAgriculture and Food Management\n251\nSEEDS-QUALITY AND USE OF FERTILISERS: The Critical \nDifferentiator\n9.12\t\t The adage “As you sow, so shall you reap” effectively reflects the significance of \nseed quality and the accessibility of seeds in sufficient quantities by farmers in promoting \nhealthy crop growth. In the 2023-24 season, ICAR produced 1.06 lakh quintals of breeder \nseeds encompassing 1,798 varieties across 81 crops for further multiplication. Given the \nimpact of weather on agricultural output, research into climate-resistant seeds has become \na priority, with 2,177 of the 2,593 new varieties released since 2014 specifically addressing \nthis challenge. To ensure that these varieties are readily available, seed banks have been \nestablished. In regions such as north-western India, heat-tolerant wheat varieties have \nseen widespread adoption to alleviate the effects of heat stress. In FY24, demonstrations \nof climate-resilient technology packages were conducted in 121 vulnerable districts under \nthe National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture initiative. \n9.13\t\t Soil degradation, particularly the decline in organic carbon content, poses \na significant challenge to Indian agriculture. Many soils in India are deficient in \norganic carbon, macronutrients, and essential micronutrients such as boron, iron, \nand sulphur. This deterioration of soil health adversely affects fertility, productivity, \nand overall agricultural sustainability. To achieve optimal crop yields while ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability, it is imperative to use fertilisers judiciously. Recently \nintroduced, ‘Urea Gold’ combines urea with sulphur, minimizing wastage and enhancing \nplant nutrient uptake. Additionally, the use of drones and fertigation12  techniques are \nbeing implemented to optimize fertiliser applications. The Programme for Restoration, \nAwareness Generation, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother Earth (PM-\nPRANAM) initiative incentivises states to adopt alternative fertilisers such as Nano \nUrea, Nano Diammonium phosphate (DAP), and organic fertilisers. By promoting these \nsustainable options, the government aims to improve soil health, reduce environmental \npollution, and boost agricultural productivity.\nRAINFALL AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM: Building Efficiency and \nExtending Coverage \n9.14\t\t Precipitation is crucial in the global water cycle, serving as a primary source \nfor freshwater replenishment, vital for various ecosystems and human activities. \nThe repercussions of climate change on rainfall patterns are profound, particularly \nconcerning agricultural practices that rely heavily on consistent and predictable weather \nconditions (Porter et al., 2014)13. \n9.15\tIn India, while the volatility in agricultural growth has notably diminished over \ntime due to targeted interventions, the sector remains highly vulnerable to weather \n12  \u0007Fertigation is a method of fertiliser application in which fertiliser is incorporated within the irrigation water by \nthe drip system.\n13  \u0007Porter, J.

A \nsubstantial portion of the agricultural land relies on rain-fed systems, making it \nespecially susceptible to fluctuations in precipitation. Moreover, more than two-\nthirds of India's agricultural land faces the threat of drought, with national estimates \nindicating a 35 per cent probability of drought occurrences15. This risk is not uniform \nacross the country; it varies considerably based on geographies. For instance, in dry-\nhumid regions, the likelihood of drought is relatively lower at about 20 per cent, while \nin arid zones, it can exceed 40 per cent. Such disparities emphasise the urgent need for \nregion-specific strategies to mitigate drought risk16. \n9.16\t The implications of erratic monsoon patterns are particularly pronounced for \nmarginal and small-scale farmers, representing approximately 85 per cent of India's \nagricultural holdings. These farmers typically cultivate on plots less than 2 hectares in \nsize, making them highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability.17.\nChart IX.7: Increase in gross irrigated area \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n2010-11\n2011-12\n2012-13\n2013-14\n2014-15\n2015-16\n2016-17\n2017-18\n2018-19\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22\nper cent\nGross irrigated area as a per cent of gross cropped area\nSource: Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare\n9.17\t \t Climate change is a problem because it accentuates weather variability.

Negi and Ramaswami (2024)21 examined the relationship \nbetween crop yields and rainfall across India at the district level for nine key crops \nduring the kharif season. They found a strong link between significant rainfall \nshortfalls and substantial crop yield losses. This statistical phenomenon is known as \nlower tail dependence, indicating that the correlation between yield losses and rainfall \ndeficits is stronger for extreme rainfall deficiencies than for minor variations. Other \nstudies have indicated that a potential 2°C rise in annual temperature and a 7 per cent \nincrease in annual rainfall by 2099 could lead to an 8-12 per cent decline in Indian \nagricultural productivity22. Birthal et.al (2021)23 found that heat stress harmed crop \nyield, which worsened over time. Most studies have suggested that droughts and heat \nwaves negatively impact agricultural productivity compared to floods and cold waves \nin India. It is, therefore, pertinent to increase the area under irrigation and diversify \ntowards heat and water-resistant crops. \n9.19\tBetween FY16 and FY21, India experienced a significant increase in irrigation area \ncoverage and intensity. The coverage of irrigation area has increased between FY16 \nand FY21 from 49.3 per cent to 55 per cent of the gross cropped area (GCA), while \nirrigation intensity has risen from 144.2 per cent to 154.5 per cent. States such as Punjab, \nHaryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana exhibit high irrigation coverage of their gross \ncropped area, with figures around 98 per cent, 94 per cent, 84 per cent, and 86 per \ncent, respectively.

About 5.9 crore \nfarmers that are currently getting benefitted under the MISS-KCC scheme, have been \nmapped through KRP.\nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n260\n9.28\t\t The government also provides insurance for farmers through the Pradhan Mantri \nFasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). This scheme acts as a safety net for farmers against crop \nlosses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. As the largest crop insurance \nprogram in the world in terms of farmer enrolment and the third-largest by premiums, \nPMFBY offers comprehensive risk coverage from the pre-sowing to post-harvest \nstages. By ensuring financial stability, the scheme encourages farmers to adopt modern \nagricultural practices and technologies, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity \nand food security. In response to recommendations from various committees, the \nscheme has recently launched several technological interventions, such as YES-TECH, \nWINDS, and CROPIC28. These advancements have increased transparency within the \nscheme ecosystem by minimizing human intervention and fostering greater trust among \nstakeholders, including implementing States/UTs and and insurance companies. The \nparticipation of State governments and insurers has increased to 24 and 15, respectively, \nin FY25, up from 20 and 11 in the 2020-21. Additionally, these interventions have \ncontributed to a 32 per cent reduction in premium rates compared to previous years. As a \nresult, in the FY24 period, the number of enrolled farmers reached 4 crore, a 26 per cent \nincrease from 3.17 crore in the FY23 period. The insured area also expanded to 600 lakh \nhectares in FY24, reflecting a 19 per cent rise from 500 lakh hectares in FY23. Both the \nacreage and farmer enrolment figures under the scheme are at an all-time high.\nAGRICULTURE MECHANISATION: Facilitating access \n9.29\t\t The high machinery cost presents a significant barrier to promoting farm \nmechanisation among small and marginal farmers. Custom hiring arrangements can \nenhance these farmers' adoption of farm mechanisation, particularly in regions where \nmechanisation is currently limited.

It provides capital subsidies to \nindividuals, farmers, and cooperatives to develop storage infrastructure. The AMI is \na capital investment program that is open-ended, demand-driven, credit-linked, and \nfeatures a back-ended subsidy mechanism.\n9.33\t\t Under this sub-scheme, a subsidy of 25 per cent is granted for projects in the \nplains, while projects in the North-Eastern, hilly, and other specified regions, as well \nas those led by women, SC/ST promoters, and FPOs, can receive a subsidy of 33.33 \nper cent. The subsidies support the establishment of a range of agricultural marketing \ninfrastructure projects, including storage facilities, rural haats, common facilitation \ncentres for FPOs, market yard infrastructure, direct marketing facilities, mobile post-\nharvest29 operations, cold storage facilities, and integrated value chain projects up to \nthe primary processing stage.\n29  \u0007Mobile post-harvest systems are portable solutions for processing, storing, and handling agricultural produce \nnear harvest sites to reduce losses and maintain quality.\nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n262\n9.34\t\t As of October 31, 2024, 48611 storage infrastructure projects have been \nsanctioned, with ₹4,795.47 crore disbursed in subsidies. In addition, 21004 projects \nrelated to other types of infrastructure assisted under the AMI scheme have been \nsanctioned, amounting to a subsidy of ₹2,125.76 crore.\nBOX IX.5 : Empowering Farmers: The Success Story of MAHAFPC\nMaha Farmers Producer Company Limited (MAHAFPC), a state-level producer company in \nMaharashtra, has empowered 646 FPOs to procure and sell agricultural products, including \npulses and perishable items. It has helped farmers by providing multiple procurement \ncentres, reducing transportation costs, and ensuring timely payment at MSP. In 2022, \nMAHAFPC became Maharashtra's largest procurement channel, benefiting over 1.7 lakh \nfarmers. The company has also assisted FPOs in developing infrastructure like storage \nfacilities and processing units. By connecting FPOs with private players and using digital \ntechnology, MAHAFPC has created employment opportunities and strengthened the \nagricultural value chain30. \n9.35\t\t Another scheme is the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) launched in 2020 \nto boost farm-gate infrastructure further and improve private sector involvement. \nThis fund provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and \ncommunity farming projects, offering interest subvention and credit guarantees and \nsupporting various projects such as custom hiring centres, processing units, warehouses, \nand cold storage facilities. \nBOX IX.6 : Innovative Ways of Land Leasing – Case of Kerala\nThe Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, introduced by NITI Aayog, is a model law \naimed at legalising and facilitating the leasing of agricultural land in India. The objective is \nto improve land access for landless and marginal farmers and provide them with various \nbenefits and protections while safeguarding the rights and interests of landowners. The \nstates of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have attempted to introduce some forms of land \nleasing. However, the state government of Kerala has created an innovative arrangement \nfor land leasing. Under this, women or men’s SHG groups lease land for more than 3 years \nfor horticulture cultivation. This agreement is made under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, \nin which the lessee offers agriculture as a service to the landlord and shares profits or pays \nfixed compensation. The Gram Panchayat (GP) becomes a party to the transaction, and the \nagreement is notarised in the GP. This helps the lessee group become eligible for benefits like \ncredit and insurance. Since the agreement lasts 3 to 5 years, it is well-suited for cultivating \nhorticulture crops. It also encourages the lessee to maintain and nurture the quality of the \nland, with findings indicating an increase in farm efficiency in terms of input-output ratio in \nthe case of group leased land compared to owned and self-cultivated land and individually \nleased land in Kerala possibly due to better convergence achieved with central and state \ngovernment support for group farming activities. The initiative has also improved land \naccess for the poor, as more than 85 per cent of the members are under the low-income category.\n30 Report of RRA Network’s market group’s paper on making markets work for rain-fed farmers.\nAgriculture and Food Management\n263\n9.36\t\t To enhance efficiency in agricultural marketing and improve price discovery, the \ngovernment has introduced the e-NAM Scheme.

The NMSA has identified key climate adaptation \nstrategies, including enhancing water efficiency, managing soil health and nutrients, \nproviding crop insurance, offering credit support, strengthening value chains, \ndelivering agro-advisories, promoting farm mechanisation, managing agricultural \nwaste, developing integrated farming systems, and supporting organic and natural \nfarming practices. It also emphasises climate-resilient varieties, livestock, and fish \nculture, promoting these initiatives through various government schemes. \n9.38\t\t To support organic farming, the government has implemented two dedicated \nschemes since 2015: the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and the Mission \nOrganic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Under \nPKVY, 52,289 clusters covering 14.99 lakh hectares and 25.30 lakh farmers have \nbeen mobilised. Similarly, under MOVCDNER, 434 Farmer Producer Companies \nhave been created, covering a total area of 1.73 lakh hectares and benefiting 2.19 lakh \nfarmers. \nBOX IX.7 : Spatial mapping of agricultural sustainability\nA Composite Index of Agricultural Sustainability was calculated by ICAR using 51 indicators \nrelated to environmental health, soil and water quality, and socioeconomic development. \nThe average estimated value of the Index is 0.49, suggesting that Indian agriculture is \nmoderately sustainable. States like Mizoram, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, \nManipur, West Bengal, and Uttarakhand perform better than the national average. \nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n264\nChart IX. 18: Composite index of agriculture sustainability-State wise\nSource: A Spatial Assessment of Sustainability in Indian Agriculture, Policy paper 42, 2024, ICAR\nIn contrast, arid Rajasthan has the least sustainable agricultural practices. According \nto the report, the states with higher sustainability scores have experienced sizable crop \ndiversification, improvement in agriculture infrastructure, farm credit and sustainable \ninput usage.

This importance is underscored \nby a remarkable increase in its contribution to the Gross Value Added (GVA) of \nagriculture and related sectors, which surged from 24.38 per cent in the fiscal year FY15 \nto an impressive 30.23 per cent by FY23. In the latter year, the livestock sector alone \nrepresented 5.5 per cent of the total GVA, reflecting its dynamic growth trajectory, with \na robust CAGR of 12.99 per cent.\n9.40\t\t The economic significance of this sector is clearly illustrated by its escalating \noutput value, which reached an astounding 17.25 lakh crore rupees (equivalent to \nUS$205.81 billion) in FY23. Among the various branches of livestock production, \nthe milk industry stands out, generating over ₹11.16 lakh crore (US$133.16 billion) in \nrevenue. This figure highlights the sector’s vitality and reveals its dominance, eclipsing \nthe aggregate production value of staple crops like paddy and wheat. The livestock \nAgriculture and Food Management\n265\nsector is thus not just a contributor to the economy; it is a cornerstone of agricultural \nprosperity and food security, propelling the rural economy and livelihoods along the \nway.\n9.41\t  The government has supported the sector through various initiatives by recognising \nthe growing importance of the livestock sector and its potential to boost farm incomes. \nThe interventions include the Rashtriya Gokul Mission for the development and \nconservation of indigenous bovine breeds, the Livestock Health and Disease Control \nProgram to enhance the well-being of livestock, the promotion of IVF technology and \nsex-sorted semen production to increase the productivity of female cows and initiatives \nto encourage the formation and growth of FPOs and SHGs to strengthen the sector. \nFurther, the mechanism of Multipurpose AI Technicians in Rural India (MAITRIs) has \nbeen established to deliver breeding inputs to farmers’ doorstep. In the last 4 years, \n38736 MAITRIs have been inducted under Rashtriya Gokul Mission. \nChart IX.19: Growth in the production of milk, meat, eggs and fish\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22\n2022-23\n2023-24\nper cent\nMilk\nEgg\nMeat\nFish\nSource: Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying and Department of Fisheries\n9.42\t\t The government has implemented several initiatives to enhance the fisheries \nsector's production and productivity over the past decade. The Pradhan Mantri \nMatsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) was established to boost aquaculture productivity \nand improve fisheries management. Additionally, the Fisheries and Aquaculture \nInfrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was introduced to provide financial support \nfor developing infrastructure in both marine and inland fisheries. Other supportive \nmeasures include the establishment of fishing harbours and fish landing centres, \nthe adoption of innovative production technologies such as cages31, Recirculating \n31  Cages are netted enclosures in water bodies like lakes or rivers, allowing water flow while containing fish.\nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n266\nAquaculture Systems (RAS)32, bio flocs33, pens34, and raceways35, as well as initiatives \nfocused on transforming waste into wealth through the expansion of saline water \naquaculture, and the growth of freshwater fisheries, cold water fisheries, ornamental \nfisheries, and pearl cultivation. Significant investment has also been made in marketing \nand transportation infrastructure, along with the development of cold storage facilities.\n9.43\t\t Due to these initiatives, total fish production (both inland and marine) has \nsurged to 184.02 lakh tonnes in FY 23, up from 95.79 lakh tonnes in FY14. Furthermore, \nIndia's seafood exports have risen from ₹46,662.85 crore in FY-20 to ₹60523.89 crore \nin 2023-24, reflecting a growth of 29.70 per cent.\n9.44\t\t Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), \nthe National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP) was launched, successfully mobilising \nand registering 16.35 lakh fish producers, workers, vendors, and processors within a \nshort timeframe of just four months.\nCOOPERATIVE SOCIETIES:  Strengthening the Institution to \nserve better\n9.45\t\t Cooperative societies in India serve a vital function across many sectors, \nincluding agriculture, credit and banking, housing, and women's welfare. These \nsocieties are essential in promoting financial inclusion, particularly by extending credit \nto farmers and small entrepreneurs who frequently encounter barriers when accessing \nconventional banking services. \n9.46\t\t To strengthen the cooperative sector, the Indian government has implemented \nvarious strategic initiatives. These include the introduction of Model Bye-Laws \nspecifically for Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), designed to provide \na structured framework for their operations. Additionally, the government has \nprioritised the computerisation of PACS to enhance efficiency and transparency. There \nis also an ongoing effort to establish new multipurpose PACS and dedicated dairy and \nfishery cooperatives, which serve diverse community needs. Another key focus is the \ntransformation of PACS into Common Service Centres (CSCs), which are intended to \nprovide services beyond financial assistance.\n9.47\t\t Other noteworthy measures aimed at enriching the cooperative landscape include \nthe establishment of retail petrol and diesel outlets and the setting up of micro-ATMs \nwithin cooperative societies to facilitate easier access to banking services. Moreover, \nthe issuance of RuPay Kisan Credit Cards specifically for dairy cooperatives aims to \nimprove the financial capabilities of these entities and their members.\n9.48\t\t The achievements of these initiatives are significant. Over 9,000 new PACS, \ndairy, and fishery cooperatives in underserved panchayats have been established, \n32  RAS uses tanks to grow fish while continuously filtering and reusing water.\n33 \u0007 \u0007Biofloc systems use microorganisms (bacteria, algae) to convert organic waste, uneaten feed, and excreta into \nprotein-rich feed directly in the water.\n34  \u0007Pens are netted enclosures in natural water bodies, restricting fish to a specific area while allowing water exchange.\n35 \u0007 \u0007Raceways are narrow channels with continuous one-way water flow, supplying oxygen and removing waste \nefficiently.\nAgriculture and Food Management\n267\nreceiving support from various federations. As part of the government's push for \ngreater accessibility, 240 PACS have applied for retail petrol and diesel outlets, with \n39 currently selected to operate, thus expanding their service offerings. Furthermore, \na substantial number—35,293 PACS—are now functioning as Pradhan Mantri Kisan \nSamriddhi Kendras (PMKSK), which are dedicated to providing essential fertilisers \nand related services to farmers, directly impacting agricultural productivity. Further, \n1,723 micro-ATMs have been distributed, facilitating doorstep financial services and \nenhancing accessibility for rural populations. \nFOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES: Critical for the Economy\n9.49\t\t The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within \norganised manufacturing, accounting for 12.41 per cent of total employment in the \norganised sector. In the fiscal year FY24, the value of agri-food exports, which includes \nprocessed food exports, reached USD 46.44 billion, constituting roughly 11.7 per cent \nof India’s total exports. Notably, the share of processed food exports within agri-food \nexports has risen from 14.9 per cent in FY18 to 23.4 per cent in FY24.\n9.50\t\t To foster growth in the food processing sector, the Indian government has \ninitiated several key programs, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana \n(PMKSY). This scheme focuses on developing modern infrastructure and optimising \nsupply chains from farm to retail. By minimising post-harvest losses, increasing \nprocessing capabilities, and enhancing export levels, PMKSY aims to promote the \noverall advancement of the food processing industry. As of 31 October 2024, 1,079 \nPMKSY projects have been completed.\n9.51\t\t The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI), \nlaunched in 2021, seeks to cultivate globally competitive food processing leaders by \nfacilitating branding and marketing initiatives in international markets. By 31 October \n2024, 171 applications had been approved under this scheme, with beneficiaries \ninvesting ₹8,910 crore and receiving ₹1,084.01 crore in incentives.\n9.52\t\t Furthermore, \nto \nprovide \ncomprehensive \nsupport—including \ntechnical, \nfinancial, and business assistance for establishing or upgrading micro food processing \nenterprises—the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises \n(PMFME) scheme was launched in 2020. As of 31 October 2024, the scheme has \nreceived 407,819 applications, with loans totalling ₹8.63 thousand crore sanctioned to \n108,580 applicants. Additionally, the programme has successfully trained 672 Master \nTrainers, 1,120 District Level Trainers, and 87,477 beneficiaries across 36 states and \nunion territories. \nFOOD MANAGEMENT: Enabling Food Security\n9.53\t\t The basic concept of food security is to ensure that there is access to basic food for \ntheir active and healthy lives. It is characterised by the availability, access, utilisation, \nand stability of food supply. While the government has long tackled household food \nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n268\nsecurity through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Targeted PDS (TPDS), the \nNational Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna \nYojana (PMGKAY) marked a fundamental shift in the approach to food security. That is \ntransitioning from a welfare-based to a rights-based approach. NFSA act legally entitles \nup to 75 per cent of the rural population and up to 50 per cent of the urban population \nto receive foodgrain, free of cost, under the Targeted Public Distribution System, \nwhich, as per Census 2011, comes to 81.35 crore persons. Therefore, about two-thirds \nof the population is covered under the Act to receive highly subsidised food grains. In \naddition, PMGKAY was introduced to alleviate the suffering of the poor and vulnerable \ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The allocation of free food grain under PMGKAY \nis in addition to the regular allocation for around 80 crore beneficiaries. The provision \nof free food grains under PMGKAY for another five years, with effect from 1st January \n2024, reflects the long-term commitment and vision of the Government for addressing \nNational food and nutrition security. \n9.54\t\t To enhance the efficiency of the Public Distribution System (PDS), the government \nis fully committed to achieving 100 per cent e-KYC compliance nationwide. This aligns \nwith the One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, allowing beneficiaries to \ncomplete electronic know your customer e-KYC anywhere, regardless of their home \nstate. Beneficiaries can authenticate their Aadhaar biometrics at any Fair Price Shop \n(FPS), making it especially convenient for migrant workers to access their entitlements. \nTo facilitate post-harvest lending for farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, \nthe government has approved the Credit Guarantee Scheme for electronic-negotiable \nwarehouse receipt (e-NWR)-based Pledge Financing (CGS-NPF). Under this scheme, \nfarmers can obtain loans against e-NWRs issued for agricultural and horticultural \ncommodities stored in accredited warehouses. The scheme covers the loss incurred by \nthe bank due to credit and warehouseman risk. The scheme will help in increasing post-\nharvest lending against e-NWRs and thereby play a role in improving farmers’ income.  \nBOX IX.8 : Measures to support foodgrain storage infrastructure in the country\n●\t  \u0007To support and upgrade the storage infrastructure for foodgrains and to ramp up the \nstorage capacity in India, steel silos are being created in PPP. \n●\t  \u0007The government is creating capacity under Hub and Spoke Model Silos, where “Hub” silos \nhave a dedicated railway siding and container depot facility. While the transportation \nfrom “Spoke” Silos to “Hub” Silos is undertaken by road, transportation from Hub to \nHub is via rail.\n●\t  \u0007To improve food grain storage, especially in hilly and remote areas, the government \nis exploring the use of Flospan, a type of Mobile Storage Unit (MSU), in collaboration \nwith the World Food Programme (WFP). These units can be quickly erected and have a \nstorage capacity of 400 metric tonnes. As a pilot project, WFP has installed Flospan in six \nstates: Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, and \nChhattisgarh. \n●\t  \u0007To modernise government grain warehouses, the government partnered with WFP and \nIGMRI to pilot a 'Smart Warehouse'. This warehouse uses sensors to monitor temperature, \nhumidity, airflow, and rodent activity, providing real-time data to improve storage and \nreduce losses.\nAgriculture and Food Management\n269\nCONCLUSION\n9.55\t\t India's agricultural sector, despite encountering various challenges, remains a \ncrucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation. This sector \nhas consistently demonstrated remarkable resilience, evidenced by stable growth rates \nsupported by a range of government initiatives to enhance productivity, diversify crop \nportfolios, and provide essential social security support for farmers.\n9.56\t\t The increasing significance of allied sectors, such as animal husbandry, dairying, \nand fisheries, underscores the importance of diversification in activities and sources of \nincome for boosting their income levels and building resilience. By tapping into these \ncomplementary sectors, farmers can create additional streams of revenue that can \nbuffer them against the inherent volatility of traditional crop production.\n9.57\t\t However, the sector is not without its challenges. Issues like climate change \nand water scarcity present significant obstacles that require focused and targeted \ninterventions. Promoting agricultural production patterns and practices that align with \nthe specific agro-climatic conditions and natural resource availabilities of different \nregions across the country is vital. Investment in research and development, especially \non climate-resistant varieties, improved agriculture practices, diversification to high-\nyield and climate-resilient crops, and micro-irrigation, can yield sustainable long-term \nbenefits. The widespread adoption of digital technologies in agriculture will unlock \nfurther possibilities for enhancing productivity. \n9.58\t\t Improving price discovery and market efficiency is another critical aspect that \nnecessitates attention. Strengthening market infrastructure is essential to facilitate this \nimprovement. This can be achieved by effectively utilising the e-NAM, a platform for \nfarmers to access broader markets. Furthermore, supporting the establishment and \noperational capabilities of FPOs and enabling cooperatives to play a more active and \ninfluential role in agricultural markets is paramount to fostering an inclusive market \nenvironment.\n9.59\tGovernment initiatives like PM-KISAN, which provides direct income support to \nfarmers, and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY), which offers pension \nschemes for farmers, have successfully contributed to bolstering farmers' incomes \nand enhancing their social security safety nets. More than 11 crore farmers have been \nbenefitted under PM-KISAN and 23.61 lakh farmers had enrolled under PMKMY as \nof 31st October 2024. In addition to these efforts, reforms such as e-KYC compliance \nunder the ONORC initiative and credit guarantee schemes for e-NWR financing address \nsystemic inefficiencies that have historically plagued the agricultural sector.\n9.60\tMoreover, there is a concerted focus on modernising food grain storage systems, \nparticularly in remote and hilly areas, which reflects a strong commitment to improving \nthe overall supply chain infrastructure. \n9.61\tWhile various initiatives have helped India’s agriculture and allied services to \ngrow under challenging circumstances, the good news is that there is still significant \nEconomic Survey 2024-25\n270\nuntapped growth potential. The right set of policies across all levels of government can \nreduce the overproduction of cereals and address the underproduction of pulses and \nedible oil. For instance, India’s farmers must be allowed to receive price signals from \nthe market unimpeded, with separate mechanisms designed to take care of the cost-of-\nliving impact on deserving households for specified durations. Two, they need to have \nmarket mechanisms to hedge their price risks. Three, they need the right policies that \nnudge them away from impairing their soil fertility with an unbalanced application \nof fertilisers and from producing already overproduced crops, which deplete India’s \nwater resources and use up electricity excessively. These policy shifts will help lift \nagricultural productivity in the economy by boosting land and labour productivity in \nthe sector. Consistent and stable growth of agriculture at around 5 per cent, with a 20 \nper cent share of overall GVA in the economy, will contribute 1 per cent growth to GVA. \nAgriculture will then absorb surplus labour even as output per worker and output per \nhectare rise. Agro-based entrepreneurship will flourish even more than it already does.  \nIn the process, India will not only achieve food security for itself but will also enable it \nfor other nations too. The possibilities are both exciting and limitless. \n******",

The crop sector has experienced \na modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1 per cent, from FY13 to FY22. \nThis increase is also largely driven by notable increases in the production of fruits, \nvegetables, and pulses. \nBox IX. 1 :  India's Floriculture: A Sunrise Industry\nIndia's floriculture industry has grown into a high-performing sector, earning its status \nas a \"sunrise industry\" with a 100 per cent export orientation5. Driven by a growing \nglobal demand for flowers, floriculture has evolved into a key commercial venture within \nagriculture. Commercial floriculture is particularly lucrative, offering higher returns per \nunit area than many traditional field crops. Profitable avenues in commercial floriculture \ninclude cut-flower production, loose-flower production, dry flowers, cut greens, pot plants, \nflower seeds, perfumes and essential oils. Ramachandra et al. (2007)6  found that including \nflowers in rice-based crop sequences gave higher net returns than other sequences, viz. rice-\nsoybean, rice-bell pepper, rice-fodder maize, rice-cowpea and rice-radish. Further, inter-\ncropping flowers are more profitable compared to the options of cereals, pulses, vegetables \nand oilseeds. With subsidy support and crop loan financing, it is a promising venture for \nmarginal and small landholdings, which constitute more than 96 per cent of the total \nlandholdings and 63 per cent of the area of cultivation under floriculture.\nChart: IX.3 Distribution of \noperational landholdings under \nfloriculture\nChart: IX.4 Exports of agri-and \nprocessed foods (April-Oct FY25 \nover April-Oct FY25\n90.9%\n5.6%\n2.6%0.8% 0.1%\nMarginal\nSmall\nSemi medium\nMedium\nLarge\n14.55\n13.39\n7.17\n6.50\n3.77\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\nFloriculure\nProcessed fruits and\nVegetables\nLivestock\nOther processed food\nTotal\nper cent\nSource: Agriculture census, 2015-16\nSource: APEDA\n5 \thttps://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead_Products/Floriculture.htm.\n6 \tRamachandra C., Anwarulla M.

With its high growth trajectory and promising export potential, India’s \nfloriculture industry is blooming as a vital player in the global flower trade7.\n9.6\t The slower growth rate of oilseeds at 1.9 per cent raises concerns, especially \nconsidering India’s heavy reliance on imports to satisfy domestic edible oil demands. \nHigh-value sectors such as horticulture, livestock, and fisheries have emerged as the \nprimary contributors to the overall growth of agriculture. Among these, the fishery \nsector has demonstrated the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at 13.67 \nper cent, followed by livestock with a CAGR of 12.99 per cent8 during FY15 to FY23(at \ncurrent prices).\nChart IX.5: International Comparison of Productivity for Selected Crops, 2022\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\nTotal Cereals\nTotal Pulses\nPaddy\nMaize\nSoyabean\nGroundnut\nkg/ha\nIndia\nWorld\nSource: Price Policy for Kharif Crops 2024-25, CACP\n9.7\t Diversity is also seen in inter-state variations in growth observed from 2011-12 to \n2020-21. Andhra Pradesh was the leading performer with a CAGR of 8.8 per cent in \nagriculture and allied sectors, excluding forestry and logging. Madhya Pradesh followed \nwith 6.3 per cent, and Tamil Nadu came in third with 4.8 per cent among major states.9 \n7  https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead_Products/Floriculture.htm.\n8 \tDepartment of animal Husbandry and Dairying.\n9 \tPrice Policy, Report Kharif 2024-25, Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices.\nAgriculture and Food Management\n249\nThese states have diversified towards crops where yield is high. For example, Andhra \nPradesh diversified towards jowar, Madhya Pradesh towards moong and Tamil Nadu \ntowards maize. Even so, there is significant potential to enhance productivity and \nreduce the yield gap compared to the global average. \n9.8\t As we look to the future, it's important to consider how changing dietary \npreferences, driven by rising incomes, will influence the agricultural sector's growth \ntrajectory. The increasing consumption of non-food grains, particularly horticultural \nproducts, livestock, and fisheries, will be significant. Given the perishable nature \nof these high-value commodities, effective post-harvest management and robust \nmarketing infrastructure are essential. This endeavour should be supported by the \nactive involvement of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and Self-\nHelp Groups (SHGs). Furthermore, substantial investment from the private sector \nwould also be vital to aid small-scale farmers.",

It is clear from the above description that happy seeder doesnot only improves the farmers \nincome but also conserve the most of the production inputs such as reduction   in   green   house   gases   emission, nutrient  recycling and soil  \nhealth  improvement .  The adoption and water use analysis in OFT confirm that HS and ZT saved irrigation time. The higher crop yield was \nrecorded Tretment T3 of 40.24 q/ ha in comparison to T2  and  T1 respectively. Gross returns were found Rs. 72000 /ha in T3  (happy seeder), in \ncomparison to  T2 Rs. 71484 /ha (ZT)  and T3 Rs.   61975  (CT).  The conclusion is Happy Seeder (HS) machine showed significantly higher yield \n(16.25%) in comparison to farmer practice.

Paroda,\nFormer Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education, Govt. of India and Director\nGeneral, Indian Council of Agricultural Research to revisit all relevant issues pertaining to functioning\nof Krishi Vigyan Kendras and suggest measures to ensure their efficiency and effectiveness in\nmeeting the stakeholders’ expectations. The Committee was assigned specific Terms of Reference\nto review: (i) mandate, (ii) sanction/establishment procedure, (iii) domain of activities\n(iv) coordination and monitoring system, (v) performance indicators, (vi) required technological\nbackstopping by the Directorates of Extension of State Agriculture Universities/Indian Council of\nAgricultural Research Institutes, (vii) sense of belongingness, (viii) convergence and linkage\nmechanisms, (ix) required infrastructural facilities, (x) personnel policies, (xi) administrative\nprocedures, (xii) financial procedures, and (xiii) other relevant matters in order to make the Krishi\nVigyan Kendras more effective, vibrant and useful.\nThe Committee had extensive discussions with various stakeholders during its 23 meetings,\nmostly held in New Delhi, and ensured wide interactions with all those involved in the Krishi\nVigyan Kendra system. The Committee has accordingly made necessary recommendations on each\nof the Terms of Reference. In addition, the Committee has also developed detailed guidelines for\nthe Management of Krishi Vigyan Kendra system in two parts, i.e. Part-I, which deals with the\n“Road Map for the Krishi Vigyan Kendra system” that include Prelude, Genesis and Growth, Vision,\nMission and Mandate, Design, Structure and Strategy, and Operational Terminology; and Part-II,\nwhich relates to Implementation of Krishi Vigyan Kendra System including Administration, Finance,\nCoordination, Implementation and Monitoring, Convergence and Linkage, Scientific and Technical\nand Capacity Development.\nThe salient recommendations of the report are summarized hereunder.\n1. All Krishi Vigyan Kendras established up to XI Plan must be converted from Plan to Non-Plan\nscheme, as per the existing procedure of the Government for required sustainability and effective\nfunctioning. Likewise, new Krishi Vigyan Kendras to be opened in subsequent Plans be\nconverted into Non-Plan Scheme, when they complete 5 years of establishment.\n2. In view of increasing expectations from Krishi Vigyan Kendra, its Vision be now defined as\n“Science and technology-led growth leading to enhanced productivity, profitability and\nsustainability of agriculture”, where as the Mission should be “Farmer-centric growth in\nagriculture and allied sectors through the application of appropriate technologies in specific\nagro-eco system perspective”. Also, the Mandate should be “Technology Assessment and\nDemonstration for its wider Application and Capacity Development”.\n3. Additional Krishi Vigyan Kendra in the district be established only based on specific criteria\nsuch as: large rural population, bigger geographical area, higher net sown area, relative\nExecutive Summary\nbackwardness norms of the district, more Tribal/Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe population,\nand those in mountainous (above 5000 feet above mean sea level) and difficult/border areas.\n4. The position of Programme Coordinator of Krishi Vigyan Kendra should be re-designated as\n‘Chief Scientist- cum-Head’, in the cadre of Principal Scientist/Professor (PB-4, ` 37400-67000\nwith GP ` 10000), for effective management, implementation of mandated activities through\nproper coordination and convergence with line departments, including the district administration.\n5. Further, all Subject Matter Specialists in Indian Council of Agricultural Research/State\nAgriculture Universities/Non-Governmental Organizations/State Government Krishi Vigyan\nKendras should henceforth be redesignated uniformly as Scientist/Assistant Professor (PB-3,\n` 15600-39100 with GP ` 6000) to ensure much needed parity across teaching, research and\nextension positions.\n6. SMSs who are in technical cadre at present in Krishi Vigyan Kendras under Indian Council of\nAgricultural Research Institute should be redeployed or redesignated as Scientists and the\npositions may be adjusted through cadre strength of the concerned Indian Council of Agricultural\nResearch institute/overall Indian Council of Agricultural Research level.\n7. The total staff strength for each Krishi Vigyan Kendra should be increased from 16 to 22,\ncomprising one Chief Scientist, 10 Scientists, one Computer Programmer, one Farm Manager,\none Lab Technician, one Technician (T-I- Field/Farm), one Assistant Administrative Officer,\none Stenographer Grade III, one Lower Division Clerk-cum- Store Keeper, two Drivers and\ntwo Supporting Staff.\n8. Since Krishi Vigyan Kendras are 100% funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research,\nthe host organizations be accorded full freedom and assume full responsibility to recruit Krishi\nVigyan Kendra staff without any restriction/ban. Krishi Vigyan Kendras should not be sanctioned\nor annual grants released unless the State Government agrees to recruit all sanctioned staff.\nAlso the staff recruited in Krishi Vigyan Kendra must not be transferred for at least five years.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding should also be clearly modified to this effect.\n9. Pay structure, as sanctioned by Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the Krishi Vigyan\nKendra staff, should be adopted by all host organizations without any variation whatsoever.\nKrishi Vigyan Kendra under Non-Governmental Organizations, which do not have approved\npromotion policy, must adopt Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme as implemented\nby the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and amended from time to time. Similarly, the\nposts that come under the definition of isolated posts in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (other than\nIndian Council of Agricultural Research and Non-Governmental Organization Krishi Vigyan\nKendras) will also follow Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme.\n10. Payment of retirement benefits in the form of Gratuity and Contributory Provident Fund for\nKrishi Vigyan Kendra staff must be made applicable by all host organizations. At the same\ntime, the benefit of study leave to the staff under Non-Governmental Organization Krishi Vigyan\nKendras be also extended as per Central Civil Service Leave Rules of 1972.\n11. The financial powers as recommended by the Committee should be delegated to the Chief\nScientist-cum-Head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, irrespective of host organizations, which should,\nhowever, be subject to budget provision.\nxiv\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n12. A non-refundable application fee of ` 25,000 (Rupees twenty five thousand only) be charged\nfrom each applicant organization for the establishment of new Krishi Vigyan Kendra. In case\nof Non-Governmental Organization applicants, they should have minimum five years working\nexperience in the field of agriculture/rural development/natural resource management/livestock\nwith proven track record in the district. Further, the information regarding newly established\nKrishi Vigyan Kendra should be given wider publicity in the district.\n13. In view of the new activities suggested for Krishi Vigyan Kendras, with enhanced manpower\nthrough a cluster approach, the operational contingency/expenses of Krishi Vigyan Kendra\nshould be increased from the present level of 9% to 25% of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra budget.\n14. In the event of unsatisfactory progress of work of any Krishi Vigyan Kendra, as assessed by the\nIndian Council of Agricultural Research from time-to-time, the Indian Council of Agricultural\nResearch shall reserve its right to terminate/close such Krishi Vigyan Kendra under any host\norganization by giving six months advance notice for the same. In that event, Indian Council of\nAgricultural Research shall not have any liability whatever, and the immovable as well as\nmovable properties constructed/acquired with the the assistance of Indian Council of Agricultural\nResearch shall remain the property of Indian Council of Agricultural Research.\n15. Krishi Vigyan Kendras should concentrate more on data generation, need assessment,\nprioritization for required technological interventions, on-farm and outreach activities with\nfocus on cluster of villages in a phased manner for 3 years and assessing the impact against\ndefined bench mark.\n16. Modalities are recommended for efficient and effective coordination, monitoring and evaluation\nof Krishi Vigyan Kendras at national, zonal, state and district levels in the areas of technical,\nadministrative, financial and manpower requirement. In addition, internal and external monitoring\nsystem has been proposed for 10% of Krishi Vigyan Kendras every year. Incentives be also\nprovided each year to the better performing Krishi Vigyan Kendras as per performance indicators.\n17. The Committee also reviewed the joint circular issued by the Department of Agricultural\nResearch and Education and Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of\nAgriculture, Government of India on required linkage between Krishi Vigyan Kendra and\nAgricultural Technology Management Agency and has recommended some specific suggestions\nto delineate responsibilities for better coordination and convergence keeping in view the mandate\nand manpower of both institutions.\n18. In the changing scenario of increased workload of Krishi Vigyan Kendras, the Committee\nrecommended the areas of convergence between Krishi Vigyan Kendras and other Government\nschemes for judicious utilization of resources, manpower, sharing of knowledge and activities\nin order to serve better the farming community in the district.\n19. The provisions of Indian Council of Agricultural Research be supplemented appropriately by\nthe host organizations to ensure proper Krishi Vigyan Kendra infrastructure in such a way that\nthe farm is a miniature of the agro-climatic situation of the district with major crops and enterprises.\nTo inculcate ownership and sense of belongingness, effective involvement and investment in\nthe activities of Krishi Vigyan Kendras should come from the top leadership of host organization.\nAlso there is a need to generate goodwill among the farming community towards the Krishi\nVigyan Kendra by promoting interfaces in different blocks and villages of the district.\nxv\nExecutive Summary\n20. The Revolving Fund should be enhanced from current ` 1 lakh to ` 5 lakh for each Krishi\nVigyan Kendra, so as to serve a single window system and assume specific responsibility and\nto also function as Agricultural Technology Information Centre.\n21. The Krishi Vigyan Kendra staff under Non-Governmental Organizations should be treated on\npar with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research/State Agriculture Universities staff\nespecially in respect of age limit, experience and other service requirements in order to overcome\nthe existing restrictions in their lateral movement. This would help in strengthening and attracting\ntalent to Non-Governmental Organization Krishi Vigyan Kendras, and provide equal opportunity\nto those working in Non-Governmental Organization Krishi Vigyan Kendras for career\nadvancement.\n22. Krishi Vigyan Kendras run by Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Non-Governmental\nOrganizations should follow General Financial Rules (GFR) - 2005 of Government of India\nfor purchase of consumables and non-consumables. Similarly, Krishi Vigyan Kendras run by\nState Agriculture Universities and State Departments should follow the purchase policy and\nprocedure as per their respective University/State Government Rules and Regulations. Local\nPurchase Committee with 2-3 members may be constituted and the powers of urgent purchases\nof store items to a maximum extent of ` 20000 (Rupees twenty thousand only) at a time be\ndelegated to Krishi Vigyan Kendra.\n23. As per Rule-212 of General Financial Rules 2005, an Audit Utilization Certificate, both in respect\nof the main account and Revolving Fund account, for each Krishi Vigyan Kendra has to be\nsubmitted by the host organization to the Zonal Project Directorate immediately after closure of\nthe financial year. In this context, Krishi Vigyan Kendras should refer to Finance Ministry’s website\n(www.finmin.nic.in) for further details.\n24. In view of the rapid increase in number of Krishi Vigyan Kendras and their activities,\nstrengthening of Agricultural Extension Division at Indian Council of Agricultural Research\nHead quarters and Zonal Project Directorates becomes a necessity for effective monitoring and\nevaluation. Accordingly, required additional manpower has been proposed, besides filling up\nof the vacant posts in Agricultural Extension Division and Zonal Project Directorates\nexpeditiously.\n25. Sectoral designation of Krishi Vigyan Kendras, viz. Pashu Vigyan Kendra, Mathsya Vigyan\nKendra, etc should not be allowed as Krishi Vigyan Kendras have to work on an Integrated\nFarming System mode and farmers as well as other stakeholders have to be provided technology\nbackstopping rather in a holistic manner.\n26. Each Krishi Vigyan Kendra should prepare a strategic plan for its activities in the district, by\ndelineating available resources and the expected outputs for each plan period.\n27. The name of Krishi Vigyan Kendra should be called in English as Agriculture Science Centre.\n28. The rules, regulations and guidelines for implementing Krishi Vigyan Kendras, as recommended\nby the Committee in the Krishi Vigyan Kendra Management Guidelines should be strictly\nfollowed. There should not be any deviation in this regard while implementing the mandate of\nKrishi Vigyan Kendras, irrespective of the variable rules and regulations of the host organizations.\nxvi\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n29. The Committee is of the view that for implementing new guidelines and have additional support\nfor staff, contingency and infrastructure, all Krishi Vigyan Kendras established so far will have\nto sign a new Memorandum of Understanding as given in the guidelines. Accordingly, for\nimplementing the suggested new management guidelines, all Krishi Vigyan Kendras be asked\nto submit new Memorandum of Understanding while receiving sanction from Indian Council\nof Agricultural Research under the XII Plan.\n30.

Country is today self sufficient in food grain production\nlargely because of the efforts made by the scientists in ICAR and State Agricultural Universities\n(SAUs)/ Central Agricultural University (CAU) backed by sound policies of the Government, ably\nsupported by the extension system and our farming community. Ushering in green, white, blue, and\nyellow revolutions could mainly be due to sound research and extension system in the country. The\nICAR has over the years evolved an effective and well-tested frontline extension system, which is\nexemplary and admired all over the world.

The KVKs under ICAR have evolved\nover the time for meeting the expectations and emerging challenges being faced by the Indian\nfarming community. The cumulative growth of KVKs since IV Five Year Plan and growth in number\nof KVKs during each Plan period is shown in Fig.1 and 2, respectively.\nAs of now, ICAR has established a total of 630 KVKs in the country under different host\norganizations viz., SAUs, CAU, ICAR Institutes, Deemed Universities (DUs), State Governments,\nPublic Sector Undertaking (PSU), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Other Educational\nInstitutions (OEI) aiming at assessment, refinement and large scale adoption of technology/products.\nAccordingly, the KVKs have been recognized as effective institutional links between agricultural\nresearch and extension system in the country.\nThe KVK activities include on-farm testing to identify the location specificity of agricultural\ntechnologies under various farming systems, frontline demonstrations to establish the production\npotential of improved agricultural technologies on the farmers’ fields, training of farmers and\nextension personnel to update their knowledge and skills. Besides, KVK works as a knowledge and\nresource centre of agricultural technologies for supporting farmers in improving their agricultural\nproduction and livelihood.\nAt present, KVK appears to be the only institutional system at the district level for technological\nbackstopping in agriculture and allied sectors. In order to make the KVK more relevant and effective\nunder the changing scenarios over the years, various committees had been constituted to review the\nprogress of KVKs and suggest much needed improvements in their functioning. The details of such\nCommittees constituted in the past are provided as under:\n1980\n:\nHigh level Evaluation Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. P.

Srivastava\n2011\n:\nEight QRTs for Zonal Project Directorates (ZPDs) in 8 Zones\nThe relevant suggestions of the above committees at various points of time had helped in\nstrengthening the functioning of KVKs as per emerging needs. Subsequently, keeping in view the\nemerging challenges before Indian agriculture, such as slow productivity growth rate, diminishing\nreturns, degradation of natural resources, climate change, competitive trade regimes, changing\nconsumer demands, etc, it has become of paramount importance to further strengthen the KVK\nsystem.\nIn addition, the existing guidelines for KVK, which were developed during 1999, no longer",
    "answer": "ddress clearly the management and technical issues nor they address precisely the decisions revised\nfrom time to time. Besides, Performance Audit of Agricultural Extension activities of ICAR by the\nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG) also suggested updating of guidelines for KVK. Hence,\nfor a vibrant KVK system, a pre-requisite is to have detailed and precise guidelines with clarity and\nprecision, which touches upon all important, related issues.\nUnder this backdrop, Hon’ble Union Minister of Agriculture and Food Processing Industries\nand the President of ICAR Society decided to constitute a High Power Committee (HPC), under the\nChairmanship of Dr.R.S.Paroda, former Secretary, DARE & Director General, ICAR to review all\nissues pertaining to KVK system and suggest measures for improving their efficiency and relevance\nso as to meet the current expectations of stakeholders.\nThe Committee was constituted by the ICAR vide Office Order F.No.5-5/2011-AE-II/173-179\ndated 02 May, 2011 as per details below:\nDr. R.S.

Secretary (DAC), Secretary (DAHD&F), Senior officials\nfrom Planning Commission, DAC and DAHD&F, Vice Chancellors of SAUs, Chairpersons of NGOs,\nDirectors of Extension, Senior officials from State Governments, Representatives of Corporate\nSector, Farmers, Programme Coordinators of KVKs, Secretary, DARE & Director General, ICAR\nand other concerned officials including Directors of ICAR Institutes. Information about these\nmeetings is given in Annexure-I, whereas the proceedings are provided as soft copy in the Compact\nDisc (CD) along with the report.\nSynthesis of recommendations of previous committees and the major common recommendations\nof various QRTs are given in Annexure-II and III, respectively.\nAction plans emerging from these proceedings were analyzed, synthesized and prioritized to\nformulate the final recommendations as per given ToR.\nCHAPTER - 3\nThe Process and Interactions\nThe Committee has given its recommendations in this chapter under the following broad sub-\nsections with main goal of making KVK system more effective, efficient and vibrant.\n4.1 Mandate and Domain of activities\n4.2 Establishment and Infrastructure\n4.3 Coordination, Implementation and Monitoring\n4.4 Convergence and Linkage\n4.5 Administrative Guidelines\n4.6 Financial Management\n4.7 Visibility of KVK system\nBefore presenting the recommendations as per ToR, the Committee felt it necessary to submit\nto Hon’ble Union Agricultural Minister/Secretary, DARE & Director General, ICAR the following\ntwo interim recommendations for immediate consideration in view of the finalization of XII Five\nYear Plan proposal for KVKs.\n(i) Conversion of KVK Scheme from Plan to Non-Plan Scheme\nThe KVK Scheme is being funded from the Plan Budget since as inception (1974). Hence, the\nfunds required for efficient functioning are often not available to the required extent as major\ncomponent goes for staff salary. Therefore, it is critical now to project a part of the expenditure\nunder Non-Plan instead of booking the entire expenditure under Plan. Accordingly. It is proposed\nthat the requirement of funds in respect of eight ZPDs and KVKs (Salary, Travelling Allowance\n(TA), contingencies, HRD etc.) established till the end of X Plan, i.e. those in existence for more\nthan five years be, as a policy decision, allowed to be included under Non-Plan from the beginning\nof XII Plan period during the XII Plan under Non-Plan budget.\n(ii) Additional scientific positions in each KVK based on its increased work load\nAs of today, each KVK has a total staff strength of sixteen which includes a Programme\nCoordinator, six Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs), three Programme Assistants and six Supporting\nStaff. With the passage of time, the work load of KVKs has increased manifold. Keeping in view\nthe emerging challenges and additional programmes to be initiated now, the Committee is convinced\nthat four additional scientific positions in each KVK are fully justified. Therefore, it is proposed\nthat at least ten positions of SMS be provided in each KVK to do proper justice to the work load and\nalso to meet the aspirations of our farming community. It is also observed by the Committee that the\nProgramme Coordinator, who has to monitor and supervise other staff and have regular meetings\nwith Heads of the Line Departments, including. Deputy Commissioner/District Collector/District\nMagistrate etc., who are invariably Class I Officers, the rank of Programme Coordinator be elevated\nto that of Professor level. This is fully justified in the best interest of efficient functioning of KVKs.\nThe copy of letter written in this regard is annexed in Annexure-IV.\nChapter - 4\nRecommendations\n8\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nIn addition to the above, Committee examined the current situation relating to the staff position\nand their designation and has come out with the following suggestions:\n(a) Strengthening of manpower at AED\nIn view of the enhanced activities and large network of KVKs, and additional scheme, provision\nof additional manpower in AED has become essential for effective monitoring and coordination.\nAfter considerable deliberations and review of existing manpower, the Committee recommends the\nfollowing staffing pattern at head quarters:\nSl.\nCadre\nNo. of posts\nMajor responsibilities\nNo.\nExisting\nProposed\n1\nDeputy Director General\n1\n1\nOverall supervision, coordination and monitoring\nof KVK system.\n2\nAssistant Directors General\n2\n3\nThree Assistant Directors General to act as branch\nofficers for three sub regions consisting of\ndifferent zonal programmes. Their major\nresponsibilities include;\n– Assist the Deputy Director General in\nformulating, implementing and monitoring\npolicy guidelines and strategies related to\nKVK system.\n– Deal with all matters pertaining to KVKs\nincluding linkage with SAUs/CAU, State\nGovernments, NGOs and ICAR Institutes, and\n– Prepare various technical reports, materials,\nreplies for Regional Committees, EFC/SFC,\nGB/AGM and Parliament questions/matters.\n– Any other responsibility assigned by Deputy\nDirector General\n3\nPrincipal Scientist\n1\n1\nTo assist Deputy Director General including\nspecial schemes.\n4\nSenior Scientists\n2\n3\nTo assist three Assistant Directors General .\n5\nDeputy Secretary\n1\n1\nAssist the Deputy Director General  in\nadministrative, financial and policy matters.\n6\nSenior Finance & Accounts\n-\n1\nPrepare Plan and Annual Budgets, get and release\nOfficer\nfunds, review utilization and guide implementing\nagencies on all financial matters through ZPDs.\n7\nUnder Secretary\n2\n2\nAssist in all administrative and policy matters\nrelated to manpower and infrastructure in KVK\nsystem, scrutiny of MoU/Agreement and\ncomplete the formalities required for\nimplementing the recommendations of IMC,\nEFC/SFC, GB/AGM and Parliament.\n8\nSection Officer\n2\n3\nAssist in administrative and financial matters in\nthe Division, linked to each Assistant Director\nGeneral .\nTotal\n11\n15\n9\nRecommendations\n(b) Strengthening of manpower at ZPDs\nIn view of the additional responsibilities of coordination and monitoring related to technical,\nadministrative and financial matters the Committee recommends the following staffing pattern at\nzonal level:\nSl.\nCadre\nNo. of posts\nMajor responsibilities\nNo.\nExisting\nProposed\n1\nZonal Project Director\n1\n1\nOverall supervision, coordination and monitoring\nof activities of KVKs in the Zone.\n2\nPrincipal Scientist\n1\n1\nPlanning, coordinating and monitoring.\n3\nSenior Scientist\n3\n4\nCapacity development, database management\nand documentation, research on technological\napplications\n4\nScientist\n2\n2\nAssisting Zonal Project Director and other\nscientists in technical aspects\n5\nComputer Programmer\n1\n1\nAssisting in database management\n6\nTechnical Assistant T-3\n-\n3\nAssisting Scientists of ZPD in field activities at\nKVKs.\n7\nAssistant Administrative Officer\n1\n1\nAssisting Zonal Project Director in administrative\nmatters\n8\nAssistant Finance and Accounts\n1\n1\nAssisting Zonal Project Director in financial\nOfficer\n matters\n9\nPrivate Secretary\n1\n1\n10\nAssistant\n2\n2\n11\nUpper Division Clerk\n1\n1\n12\nDriver\n1\n1\n13\nLower Division Clerk\n2\n2\n14\nSkilled Support Staff\n2\n2\nTotal\n19\n23\n(c) Strengthening of manpower in KVK\nAt present, there are six SMSs (recommended to be re-designated as Scientists), each one\ntaking care of one subject matter area. The KVKs have to provide multidisciplinary and broad-\nbased technological interventions to enable farmers to manage their farm in a sustainable and\nintegrated manner, which demands enhanced manpower not only in terms of number but also covering\nthe most important subject matter areas relevant to the district. With ever-growing nature and quantum\nof workload of each KVK, the existing six SMSs are finding it difficult to cope up with their\nresponsibilities. It is, therefore, recommended that four additional posts of SMSs (Scientists) should\nbe created in each KVK, thus, increasing the number of SMSs to 10.\n10\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nKeeping in view the administrative and financial aspects as per the proposed guidelines, the\nCommittee recommends that the post of Assistant in KVK may be upgraded to that of Assistant\nAdministrative Officer and one new post of Lower Division Clerk-cum-Store Keeper be created.\nIn order to support the scientists in data collection, one post of Technician (T-I-Field/Farm) is\nalso recommended.\nThus, the Committee recommends that the total staff strength for each KVK should be 22 as\nagainst 16 at present.\n(d) Designation of KVK staff\nThe increased role, activities and objectives necessitate senior-level functionary as Head of\nKVK. The Committee therefore, recommends that the Head of KVK be designated as ‘Chief Scientist-\ncum-Head’ in the cadre of Principal Scientist/Professor (PB-4, ` 37400-67000 with GP of ` 10000).\nFurther, all SMSs in ICAR/SAUs/CAUs/NGOs/State Governments PSU/OEI/KVKs should\nhenceforth be redesignated uniformly as Scientist/Assistant Professor (PB-3, ` 15600-39100 with\nGP ` 6000) to ensure much needed parity across teaching, research and extension positions.\n(e) KVK staff in ICAR institutes\nThe SMSs who are in the technical cadre at present in the KVKs run by ICAR Institutes should\nhenceforth be redeployed/re-designated as Scientists only and the positions must be adjusted through\ncadre review at the concerned ICAR institute level or through redeployment of scientific positions\nat the overall ICAR level.\n(f) New MoU\nThe Committee is of the view that for implementing new guidelines and have additional support\nfor staff, contingency and infrastructure, all KVKs established so far will have to sign a new MoU\nas given in the guidelines. Accordingly, for implementing the suggested new management guidelines,\nall KVKs be asked to submit new MoU while receiving sanction from ICAR under the XII Plan.\n(g) Management guidelines for KVK system\nThe Committee also gone into greater details in view of the ToR assigned as well as keeping in\nview the KVK momentum and recommended that KVK management guidelines should have two\nparts as given below:\n●The first part should provide a road map for the KVK system which should indicate theoretical\nframe work relating to prelude about the future Indian agriculture, genesis and growth of KVK\nsystem in the country, vision, mission and mandate, design, functional structure and strategies\nand various terminologies so as to understand the KVK system and its role in changing scenario\nof agriculture.\n●The second part should emphasize on the practical framework for the implementation of KVK\nsystem. This part should serve as guideline for administration, finance, coordination,\nimplementation and monitoring, convergence and linkage, scientific and technical aspects, and\ncapacity development for effective implementation of KVK system.\n11\nRecommendations\n4.1 Mandate and domain of activities\n4.1.1 Mandate of KVK\nKeeping in view the importance of translational research for effective technology dissemination\nand considering the changing agricultural scenario, the suggested Vision, Mission and Mandate of\nKVK are now proposed as:\nVision:\nScience and technology-led growth leading to enhanced productivity,\nprofitability and sustainability of agriculture.\nMission:\nFarmer-centric growth in agriculture and allied sectors through\napplication of appropriate technologies in specific agro-ecosystem\nperspective.\nMandate:\nTechnology Assessment and Demonstration for its wider Application\nand to enhance Capacity Development (TADA-CD).\nTo implement the mandate effectively through creation of awareness about improved agricultural\ntechnologies, the following activities be defined for each KVK.\n(a) On-Farm Testing (OFT) to assess the location specificity of agricultural technologies under\nvarious farming systems.\n(b) Out scaling of farm innovations through Frontline Demonstration (FLD) to showcase the\nspecific benefits/worth of technologies on farmers’ fields.\n(c) Capacity development of farmers and extension personnel to update their knowledge and\nskills in modern agricultural technologies and enterprises.\n(d) Work as Knowledge and Resource Centre for improving overall agricultural economy in\nthe operational area.\n(e) Conduct frontline extension programmes and provide farm advisories using Information\nCommunication Technology (ICT) and other media on varied subjects of interest to farmers.\n(f) Data documentation, characterization and strategic planning of farming practices.\nKVK, while acting as a single window Agricultural Technology Information Centre\n(ATIC), should produce quality technology related inputs/products (seeds, planting materials, bio-\nagents, livestock, fingerlings etc,) and make them available to farmers. Besides, identify and\ndocument selected farmer-led innovations and converge with ongoing schemes and programmes\nwithin the mandate of KVK.\n12\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n4.1.2\nDomain of activities\n(a) Data generation\n●Creation of database on the district profile based on the secondary data. The database should\nhave details about blocks/villages, demography including farmers (small, marginal and large),\nlivestock population, weather data, distribution of land, area under major crops, production\nand productivity trends of crops, livestock, fisheries and allied sectors, home-scale enterprises\nand socio economic profile. Besides, details of inputs, marketing, processing, extension service\nproviders etc., may also be maintained in the database.\n●KVK should work in a cluster approach wherein 4-5 villages covering farm families dominated\nby small and marginal farmers selected preferably from different agro-ecosystems and continue\nwork in the selected cluster(s) for 3 years with phased out strategy to implement similar activities\nacross the district by moving to new cluster of villages for another 3 year cycle.\n●Base-line data of the cluster villages need to be collected through PRA and other participatory\nmethods and it should specifically reflect on problems related to agriculture and allied sectors.\nThe progress thus, made be documented every year and be compared with the base-line data\nfor assessing the impact of KVK interventions.\n(b) Need assessment and prioritization\n●Address district-specific needs in agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, livestock, poultry and\nagro-forestry by identifying and prioritizing problems.\n●Extent, severity, importance and frequency of the problems in the existing farming conditions\nshould be considered as main criteria for identification and prioritization.\n●Identify primary and secondary factors/biotic and abiotic causes of each prioritized problem\nand plan for appropriate interventions.\n●Each Scientist in KVK should address at least one most relevant issue of the\narea.\n(c) Technological interventions\n●Prepare work plan for cluster of villages with well-defined output/deliverables.

They may also seek the\nsupport of Zonal Project Directors  in ensuring proper technological backstopping even if it is\nrequired from other institutions/organization.\n●Periodical visits of technical experts from the University/ICAR Institute to KVKs irrespective\nof the host organizations essentially should be organized for providing guidance and advice at\ndifferent stages of technological interventions.\n●Capacity development activities should be organized in identified areas for KVK staff at the\nUniversities, ICAR Institutes and other specialized organizations.\n●Facilitating KVKs to get latest technologies from NARS for production of technological inputs\nas well as carrying out interventions for the benefit of farmers.\n●Publication and updating of district-specific technology inventory.\n●Ensure the participation of Chief Scientist-cum-Heads of all the KVKs in ZAREC as members.\n●Facilitate KVKs in having interface and convergence with different stakeholders in the district.\n25\nRecommendations\n4.4 Convergence and linkage\nAs the frontline extension system of ICAR, KVKs have the onerous job of strengthening the\ntechnology adaptation mechanisms among farmers. Having been recognized as the only scientific\ninstitution at the district level in agriculture and allied sectors, every KVK has to work in harmony\nand partnership with many organizations for achieving its goals and objectives, which necessitate\nfunctional linkage with all development agencies/organizations and other stakeholders, especially\nthe farmers.\n4.4.1\nCoordination between KVK and ATMA\nRealizing the importance of joint functioning of KVK and ATMA, the DAC and DARE have\njointly issued a circular on 27.01.2011 to all concerned organizations. As the coordination and\nconvergence is an important issue for strengthening agricultural extension system in the country,\nthe Committee had detailed deliberations with the senior officials of DAC, Planning Commission,\nsome senior Vice Chancellors of SAUs, few state officers and senior experts, besides Director\nGeneral, Deputy Director General (Agricultural Extension), ICAR and other functionaries. The\nminutes of the meeting held on 14-15 December, 2011 are provided in the CD attached with this\nreport. There was general consensus that the existing mechanism of coordination between KVK\nand ATMA must be revisited to ensure better complementarities and improved efficiency. Also,\nlinkage with other programmes funded by the Central Government (RKVY, MGNREGA, NFSMS,\nNHM, ISOPAM etc) and the State Governments will help in ensuring greater impact on the livelihood\nof smallholder farmers. Committee was of the view to have more innovative ways devised to have\nyet better and more effective linkages. In this context, first priority should be to revisit the guidelines\non coordination and convergence between KVK and ATMA and to delineate specific responsibilities\non either side both for effective output and avoidance of duplication, if any. In this regard, it would\nbe appropriate if the following suggestions of the Committee are taken into consideration.\n●In a true partnership mode, the KVK should function as a frontline extension system, whereas,\nATMA to act as a field extension agency for large scale technology dissemination/adoption. As\nsuggested in this report that while KVKs would work in a “cluster mode”, the district level\nATMA functionaries could take lead in out scaling of successful technologies/innovations\nthrough large-scale demonstrations and further verification/validation.\n●While KVK would have major responsibilities for technology verification and its upscaling,\nATMA could play an important role for large scale dissemination through involvement of mass\nmedia (ICT, Radio, TV etc), farmers’ organizations, NGOs and private sector. It could also be\nthe major player for public awareness and large scale supply of technology linked inputs. On\nthe contrary, KVK should assume specific role of ATIC through production of seeds, planting\nmaterials, livestock materials, fingerlings value-added products, publications, prototypes of\nsmall implements, etc.\n●The Project Director, ATMA and his team should plan periodical joint visits to the cluster\nvillages of KVKs for gaining first-hand knowledge on new technologies being demonstrated\nso that activities could be initiated under ATMA for large-scale disseminations. Apart from\ncluster villages, the problems or issues noticed by Project Director, ATMA and his staff in other\nvillages could be brought to the notice of KVK staff to ensure necessary follow-up.\n26\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●There should be an effective coordination mechanism between Chief Scientist-cum-Head of\nKVK and Project Director of ATMA through a joint coordination committee, which must meet\nmore frequently. Also the Project Director of ATMA should participate regularly in the SAC\nmeetings of KVKs.\n●At the district level, ATMA and KVK should have joint meetings on the pattern of central level\npre-kharif and pre-rabi workshops in which all other stakeholders be also invited.\n●ATMA functionaries should support and actively participate in “Technology Week” being\norganized by KVKs that comprises of live demonstrations, exhibitions, ensuring availability of",

    "answer": "nd capacity development of state extension functionaries (block/district level field officials)\nand farmers be made available to concerned KVKs by Project Director, ATMA.\n●While SAUs/CAU/ICAR Institutes/NGOs hosting KVKs would have major responsibility for\neffective functioning of KVKs in the State, the concerned departments of agriculture/horticulture/\nanimal husbandry/fisheries assume greater ownership role so as to have multiplying effect of\nboth sides, i.e. research and development departments.\n4.4.2 Convergence/linkage among KVKs and other Government schemes\nFor effective coordination and convergence, there is need to draw a silver line for defined\nresponsibilities so that there is obvious clarity in functions and roles. The Committee is of the view\nthat the convergence has to be in terms of sharing of knowledge, resources and experiences and\nrecommends the following guidelines.\n●KVK should indentify and initiate action on the priority areas indicated in the Comprehensive\nDistrict Agriculture Plan (CDAP).\n●KVK must harness available ICT programmes of development departments and Ministries (eg.\nSMS Portal, Common Service Centres, Video-Conferencing facilities of NIC etc.) through\neffective networking.\n●Greater involvement of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department would help KVKs in\npursuing IFS approach.\n●Scientists-extension functionaries-farmers interface should be frequently be organized by KVKs\nto reaffirm the utility of results under local conditions so as to out scale technologies.\n●The field-functionaries of NGOs working in agriculture and allied sector have to be treated as\nimportant partners especially for their capacity building efforts for technology transfer.\n●To build capacities of rural youth as technology agents, through vocational training programme,\nit will be essential to link them to bankable projects. Hence, for effective services to farmers on\ncustom hiring basis/out sourcing, linkages with credit extending organizations will be highly\nessential.\nIn order to coordinate and monitor effectively the above suggested areas of convergence, the\nCommittee is of the view that ICAR should set up with approval of its President (Minister of\n27\nRecommendations\nAgriculture) Joint-Coordination Committee at the National level and also ensure establishment of\nsimilar Joint-Coordinations at State and District levels as specified in Annexure-VI.\n28\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n4.5 Administrative guidelines\n4.5.1 Personnel policies\nStrengthening of KVK with qualified manpower is essential as they are functioning for\nknowledge sharing and technology application in agriculture and allied sectors. Since KVKs are\nhosted by different organizations having varied recruitment and promotion policies, the Committee\nrecommended the following:\n(a) Manpower\nWith respect to disciplines, the following pattern is recommended as per the need of the district.\nOut of 10 Scientists, 8 posts should be in the core disciplines namely,\n(i) Agricultural Extension\n(ii) Agronomy/Soil Science\n(iii) Plant Protection (Entomology/Plant Pathology)\n(iv) Plant Breeding/Seed Technology (To strengthen the participatory seed production and\nmaintenance breeding in the farmers’ fields as well as at instructional farm of KVK, the\ndiscipline of Plant Breeding/Seed Technology is required at KVK.)\n(v) Animal Science/Fisheries\n(vi) Horticulture\n(vii) Home Science\n(viii) Agriculture Engineering (Post Harvest Technology/Value addition)\nThe other two posts could be out of other disciplines such as:\n(i) Animal Science/Fisheries/Agroforestry/Plant Pathology\n(ii) Agri-Business Management/Agricultural Economics\n(b) Recruitment of staff\n●Since KVKs are 100% funded by the ICAR, the host organizations shall get an undertaking\nfrom the respective State Governments that there shall be no restriction/ban for recruiting all\nthe sanctioned KVK posts.\n●In case of KVKs under SAUs/CAU/ICAR Institutes/State Governments, the recruitment of\nKVK staff is to be done as per the recruitment/selection procedures followed/existed in their\nrespective host organisations. However, one member of the Recruitment/Selection Committee\nshould be from the respective ZPD.\n●In the case of KVKs functioning under the NGO, the NGO should advertise the posts in\nEmployment News and a leading local newspaper, and details are to be posted on websites of\nhost organization and KVK. Invariably, advertisements should appear 6 months in advance of\nthe retirement date so that the new incumbent will be in position on the day the post falls\n29\nRecommendations\nvacant. Further, applications received are to be screened by a Committee, including one\nrepresentative drawn from a nearby Agricultural University. The academic qualifications and\nexperience for the posts should not be less than what is prescribed by ICAR. The promotional\npolicy including the pay and eligibility criteria should be as applicable to similar posts in\nICAR.\n●The Recruitment/Selection Committee for the recruitment of Chief Scientist-cum-Head for\nKVKs under NGOs shall be constituted by the concerned NGO. The Committee shall comprise\nof Head of the host organization as Chairperson; Zonal Project Director, Director of nearby\nICAR institute, one Expert in the rank of Professor and above from technology backstopping\nAgricultural University to be nominated by the Vice-Chancellor; and one eminent agricultural\nexpert to be nominated by Deputy Director General (Agricultural Extension) as Members.\n●The Recruitment/Selection Committee for the recruitment of Staff other than Chief Scientist-\ncum-Head for KVKs under NGOs, shall be constituted by the concerned NGO. The Committee\nshall comprise of, the Head of the Organization as Chairperson; Zonal Project Director or his\nnominee, Representative of ICAR to be nominated by Director of nearby ICAR institute (should\nbe Group A level officer and at least one level above the level in which the recruitment is to be\nmade), and Two Experts in the relevant field to be nominated by the Vice-Chancellor of nearby\nAgricultural University (should be Group A level Officer; if not available, then an Officer at\nleast one level above the post in which the recruitment is to be made), as Members.\n●No Member (including the Chairperson) should sit in the Selection Committee for the recruitment\nof KVK staff, if any of his/her relative appears for the interview. In such cases, the senior-most\nofficer of the host organization should act as the Chairperson of the Selection Committee.\nSame rule will also be applicable for other members of the selection Committees. The\nChairperson and all the members should compulsorily require in conducting and recording the\nproceedings of selection.\n●Host organizations shall strictly adopt the pay structure sanctioned by ICAR for KVK staff\nwithout any change.\n●Contractual services should be provided for assisting Scientists. KVKs should be allowed to\nhire retired personnel on contract basis against vacant posts for a period of maximum of six\nmonths or till the recruitment is made whichever is earlier with minimum in the pay band +\nGrade Pay of respective vacant post.\n(c) Career advancement\n●The staff of AU-KVKs will get the promotional benefits as per the Rules of respective\nAgricultural Universities, subject to the condition that the upper ceiling of such promotional\npolicy including the pay and eligibility criteria will be that applicable to similar posts in ICAR.\n●If any NGO running a KVK does not have any duly approved promotion policy, Modified\nAssured Career Progression Scheme (MACPS) as implemented in ICAR and amended by ICAR\nand Government of India from time-to-time, could be adopted. In such cases, Zonal Project\nDirector or his nominee has to be one of the Members in the DPC without whom the quorum\nwill not be deemed as complete.\n30\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●For posts that come under the definition of isolated posts in KVKs (other than ICAR and NGO-\nKVKs), will also get MACPS as amended by ICAR/Government from time to time.\n●Since posts in KVKs are sanctioned in a particular Pay Band and Grade Pay, the post is required\nto be upgraded in case it is desired to continue the promoted Scientist in the KVK. In case such\na Policy and MACPS referred to above is adopted, vacancies in the event of transfer/retirement/\ndeath/resignation of the KVK personnel, carrying whatever personal Grade Pay or Post, acquired\nthrough promotion or through MACPS, shall be filled up only in the initial Grade approved\nunder KVK scheme.\n●The scorecard in respect of Scientist as provided in KVK Management Guidelines should be\nfollowed in implementing CAS/MACPS, whichever is applicable to the host organization.\nFurther, there should be a separate score card for assessing the performance of scientific staff\nin KVK for career advancement similar to the ASRB.\n(d) Allowances and policies\n●Payment of retirement benefits in the form of gratuity and Contributory Provident Fund (CPF)\nshould be admissible.\n●Leave encashment and medical allowance to KVK staff need to be given as per provisions of\nthe host organization as these are covered under the Head, ‘Pay and Allowances’.\n●The superannuation age of KVK staff shall be as per the rules of the host organization.\n●The benefit of study leave may be extended to the employees of a KVK under organizations\nother than NGOs as per rules of the host organization. In the case of staff of KVKs under\nNGOs, grant of leave, if no leave rules are available in the organization, may be regulated as\nper CCS leave rules of 1972, subject to the condition that while granting study leave the criteria\nlike only one scientist to be considered at a time, minimum of 5 years of service in KVK, and\nbond of serving in KVK for minimum 3 years after completion of study, failing which all\nexpenditure incurred towards his/her pay and allowances during study leave shall be recovered\nfrom the scientist.\n●The KVK staff under NGOs should be treated on par with the ICAR/SAUs staff especially in\nrespect of age limit, experience and other service requirements in order to overcome the existing\nrestrictions in their lateral movement. This would help in strengthening and attracting talent to\nNGO KVKs, and provide equal opportunity to those working in NGO KVKs for career\nadvancement.\n●Since the main functional duties of the staff of KVKs and staff of ZPDs are at field level,\nreimbursement of ` 500 and ` 250 per month for mobile bill may be provided to the Chief\nScientist-cum-Head and other Scientists respectively, irrespective of host organizations, and `\n500 to the Scientists at ZPDs.\n●KVK staff should not be transferred for a period of five years and concurrence of ICAR is to be\nobtained before making any transfers.\n31\nRecommendations\n(e) Recognition\n●The personnel working in KVKs should get proper recognition. Therefore, performance- linked\nsupport and incentives are to be provided to KVKs.\n●Staff working in the remote KVKs should be encouraged through special incentives in the\nform of capacity development.\n4.5.2 Procedures for purchase and construction\nICAR provides fund for the implementation of KVK scheme through the ZPDs. Funds are\nreleased to the KVKs through the respective host organizations based on the financial rules and\nprocedure laid down by the Government of India (GoI) and ICAR from time to time in General\nFinancial Rules (GFR 2005). The Committee recommends the following guidelines for financial\nprocedures for effective implementation and utilization of KVK budget.\n(a) Purchase procedure\n●The KVKs run by ICAR and NGOs should follow GFR 2005 of GoI for purchase. KVKs run\nby Agricultural Universities and State Departments should follow the purchase policy and\nprocedure as per their respective University/State Government rules and regulations.\n●KVKs should maintain purchase files/ledgers properly in respect of each significant purchase,\nwhich should give full information regarding indents, administrative approval of the competent\nauthority, quotations, comparative statement of the quotations, selection of the offer, expenditure\nproposal on the basis of the selected offer, prior expenditure concurrence of the internal finance,\nsanction by the competent authority, issue of supply order, receipt of the articles, inspection\nand verification of the stores, installation and commissioning, stock entry certification, details\nof entries made in the assets register, preparation of bill for payment, details of payments made\nindicating cheque number, date and amount.\n●KVKs should maintain assets register and stock register for assets and consumables/non-\nconsumables, respectively. KVKS should maintain separate logbook in respect of each\nmachinery/equipment, including vehicles. Physical verification of assets and consumables as\nwell as internal audit should be conducted by ICAR or ZPDs from time to time on a random\nbasis. A certificate of verification of stores with its results should be recorded on the list, inventory\nor account, as the case may be. After the prescribed life period of any non-consumable store or\nasset gets over, the Committee constituted by the competent authority may in the interest of the\nKVK declare the store as obsolete. Such stores should be written off after following due\nprocedure for disposal by auction.\n(b) Execution of works\n●KVK should strictly follow the procedure laid out by the ICAR for execution of works.\n●Preparation of detailed design and estimates should precede any sanction for works.\n●No work shall be undertaken before issue of administrative approval and expenditure sanction\nby the competent authority on the basis of estimates framed.\n32\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●Open tenders will be called for works costing ` 5 lakh and above, and limited tenders will be\ncalled for works costing less than ` 5 lakh.\n●Execution of contract agreement or award of work should be done before commencement of\nthe work.\n●Final payment for work shall be made only on the basis of the certificate of the officer-in\ncharge of work after the satisfactory execution of work, in the prescribed format.\n(c) Vehicles management\n●The vehicles have to be maintained properly. All vehicles/tractors records including logbooks\nshould be maintained properly. The average mileage has to be calculated and a summary\nstatement should be recorded at the end of each month. Competent authority should attest the\nmonthly summary. New vehicle in replacement can be purchased only after obtaining approval\nfrom ICAR.\n●In the case of replacement of vehicle, the procedure laid down by the ICAR should be followed.\nThe proposal has to be submitted to the ICAR in the prescribed proforma through ZPD after\nsatisfying the conditions stipulated in the DFPRs of 1978, along with vehicle inspection report\nfrom competent authority.\n33\nRecommendations\n4.6 Financial management\n4.6.1 Budget release and implementation\n●In the case of KVKs under SAUs/CAU/DUs/State Governments, funds are released by the\nICAR to the Head of the Finance and Accounts Wing of these organizations, who in turn should\ntransfer the funds to the respective KVK’s Account without any delay, under intimation to the\nZPD. The fund should be invariably transferred through electronic mode.\n●In the first week of September, each KVK should submit the Revised Estimate for the current\nyear and Budget Estimate for the succeeding year containing the requirement of funds in specific\nbudgetary format as per EFC for approved activities to the ZPD. Similarly, the Directors of\nExtension Education shall furnish the BE/RE to the Zonal Project Director for overseeing the\nKVK activities.\n●The interest earned under short-term deposits should be credited to the KVK’s main account.\nSimilarly, the amount realized on auction of condemned vehicles, equipment, furniture and\nother items including license fee and miscellaneous receipts should be credited to the KVK\nmain account only. The realization of the receipts received under these heads should be intimated\nwell in advance to the concerned Zonal Project Director.\n●KVK should submit a monthly statement of expenditure by 3rd of every following month to the\nZPD in the prescribed format.\n●KVK should follow sub-heads and items of expenditure to be covered under two main heads\nviz., recurring and non-recurring.\n●All host organizations should ensure that no expenditure is incurred in excess of the budgetary\nallocation on approved items under recurring and non-recurring heads.\n●KVK should maintain the important records relating to financial transactions like KVK main\naccount, revolving fund account, main cash book and subsidiary cash book. Every month a\nbank reconciliation statement should be prepared to reconcile the discrepancies between the\nbalance as per bank statement and cashbook.\n4.6.2\nOperational contingency\nThe Committee had reviewed the budget allocation to each KVK and noticed that most of the\npresent budget allocation (around 90%) goes to payment of salaries. But as per the guidelines of the\ncentral sector schemes, a minimum of 25% of the budget should be allocated for operational\ncontingency. As KVK is a Plan Scheme as well as in view of the new activities suggested for\nKVKs, with enhanced manpower through a cluster approach, the Committee recommends that the\noperational contingency/expenses of KVK should be increased from the present level of 9% to 25%\nof the KVK budget allocation.\n4.6.3 Audit Utilization Certificate\n●As per rule 212 of GFR 2005, an  AUC both in respect of the main account and revolving fund\naccount for each KVK must be submitted by the host organization to the ZPD immediately\nafter closure of the financial year. KVKs may refer Finance Ministry Website\n(www.finmin.nic.in) for further details.\n34\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●In cases where Government organizations hosting KVKs find it difficult to submit the AUC\nimmediately after the closure of the financial year may get the scheme audited in respect of\nGrant-in-Aid released during the preceding year by the Chartered Accountant at their own cost\nfor the purpose of release of grant during the current financial year and furnish the UC. Such\nGovernment Organizations may get the propriety audit conducted through statutory auditors\nseparately and furnish the AUC of the Grant-in-Aid as early as possible (GFR-2005).\n●The NGOs hosting KVKs should submit the AUC at the beginning of financial year duly audited\nby the Chartered Accountant empanelled with CAG in respect of Grant-in-Aid released during\nthe preceding year to enable release of funds from the ICAR to KVKs.\n4.6.4 Revolving Fund\n●Revolving Fund shall be utilized only as per the guidelines of ICAR. A separate Bank Account\nshould be opened by the KVK for Revolving Fund. The running cost for maintenance of\ninstructional farm and demonstration units will be met from this fund.\n●The host organization shall ensure that revenue generated from the activities undertaken utilizing\nRevolving Fund is ploughed back to the fund and it should be utilized for creation of\ninfrastructure as well as for various resource generating activities of the KVK.\n●The principal amount given by ICAR has to be repaid @ 20% of the principal amount each\nyear from the commencement of 6th year on which ICAR sanctioned the fund. If a KVK fails to\nrepay the seed money and/or income generated through Revolving Fund, is taken by host\norganization, ICAR has to adjust this amount against the normal budget released to the KVK.\n●KVKs have to play the role of ATIC at district level providing single window service to farmers.\nIn order to have this functionality, the Committee recommends enhancing the Revolving Fund\nfrom ` 1 lakh to ` 5 lakh.\n4.6.5 General\n●Delegation of financial powers to Chief Scientist-cum-head of KVK should be given subject to\nbudget provision irrespective of host organizations as detailed in Annexure-VII.\n●Local Purchase Committee with 2-3 members may be constituted for KVK and delegated the\npowers for urgent purchases of store items to a maximum extent of ` 20000 at a time.\n●Every officer incurring or authorizing expenditure from public funds should be guided by high\nstandards of financial propriety. Hence, the principles like vigilance in respect of expenditure\nincurred from public money as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of\nexpenditure of his own money, the expenditure should not be prima facie more than the occasion\ndemands, nor exercise powers of sanctioning expenditure to pass an order, which will be directly\nor indirectly to own advantage; public money should not be utilized for the benefit of a particular\nperson or section of the community. The amount of allowances granted to meet the expenditure\nof any type should not be the whole source of profit to the recipients. This should be strictly\nfollowed in all KVKs while incurring expenditure.\n●KVKs should have responsibility and accountability to bring efficiency, economy, and\ntransparency in matters relating to procurement, and for fair and equitable treatment of suppliers\nand promotion of competition in procurement.\n35\nRecommendations\n4.7 Visibility of KVK system\n4.7.1\nSense of belongingness\nThe Committee felt that the host organizations should have the pride of ownership and\npossessiveness of KVKs, as they are meant for helping the farming community, which will enhance\nthe popularity and visibility of the host organization in the district. Therefore, the following\nrecommendations are made to inculcate a sense of belongingness towards KVKs among the host\norganizations;\n●Investment and effective involvement should come from the top leadership in host organization\nfor implementation of activities of KVKs.\n●Available financial provisions of ICAR shall be supplemented by the host organizations to\ndevelop the KVK infrastructure in such way that the farm is a miniature of the agro-climatic\nsituation of the district with all the representative crops and enterprises.\n●Promote interface in different blocks and villages of the district through KVKs to generate\ngoodwill among the farming community at district level. Further, host organization should\nstrengthen the communication strategy by involving innovative and progressive farmers to\ncreate public awareness for owning the KVK by different stakeholders in the district.\n4.7.2 General points\n●Those KVKs, which have excelled in their performance in certain disciplines could be considered\nas centres of excellence and supported suitably to undertake greater responsibility for human\nresource development at state, zonal and national level.\n●Information regarding various schemes of Central and State Governments related to farmers’\nbenefit/need are to be compiled and published at district level by all KVKs.\n●Performance-linked support based on transparent criteria and guidelines need to be provided.\nFor this purpose, 2% of the budget of AED should be set apart at the level of Deputy Director\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension)). Half of this amount should be made available at Zonal\nProject Director level, to be given each year, as incentive for better performing KVKs for\ninfrastructure development or programme implementation. The AED should develop the\nguidelines in this regard.\n●Each KVK should disseminate knowledge, information and literature through effective and\nexhaustive mailing list of farmers, which should be up-dated periodically.\n●Each KVK should bring more and more footprints of farmers and stakeholders through frequent\nvisits by them to the KVK.\n●The ownership for technology backstopping should not only by the Directors of Extension\nEducation but also by all the scientists of SAUs/ICAR Institutes based on their expertise and\nprovide technological backstopping through translational research for strengthening of\nlatest technologies.\nThe Committee had reviewed the present KVK system through a series of interaction-cum-\ndiscussion meetings with all stakeholders. In the previous chapters, the Committee had laid\nrecommendations on various aspects of KVK system for making it effective and efficient.\nThe Committee thought it appropriate to have a separate document drafted for suggesting KVK\nManagement Guidelines. Accordingly, Agricultural Extension Division under the leadership of\nDeputy Director General in consultation and input from all the Zonal Project Directors have tried to\nreorganize the KVK Management Guidelines into two parts using the major recommendations of\nthe High Power Committee as detailed below:\nPart - I:\nRoad Map for KVK System\nChapter-1\nPrelude\nChapter-2\nGenesis and Growth\nChapter-3\nVision, Mission and Mandate\nChapter-4\nDesign, Functional Structure and Strategies\nChapter-5\nOperational Terminology\nPart - II:\nImplementation of KVK System\nChapter-6\nAdministrative Guidelines\nChapter-7\nFinancial Management\nChapter-8\nCoordination, Implementation and Monitoring\nChapter-9\nConvergence and Linkages\nChapter-10\nScientific and Technical\nChapter-11\nCapacity Development\nAppendices I-XXXI\nThe above draft document on KVK Management Guidelines in detail is enclosed along with\nthis report as Annexure-VIII.\nThe Committee recommends that after acceptance of the report by the competent authority,\nthis document should be published as operational manual for use of KVK system and should be\nprovided to all the administration and development departments in the district.\nThere should not be any deviation while implementing the mandate of KVKs, irrespective of\nthe variable rules and regulations of the host organizations.\nSince this is a dynamic process, this should be revisited every five years based on the changing\nscenario.\nCHAPTER 5\nDevelopment of KVK Management Guidelines\nANNEXURES\n39\nAnnexures\nANNEXURE-I\nSchedule of Meetings organized by the High Power Committee\nMeeting\nDate\nVenue\nParticipants\nseries\n1\n16 August, 2011\nBoard Room, NASC,\nMembers of the HPC, Deputy Director\nNew Delhi\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension),\nAssistant Director General (Agricultural\nExtension), Zonal Project Directors,\nScientists and Officers from the AED.\n2\n19 November, 2011\nBoard Room, NASC,\nMembers of the HPC, Deputy Director\nNew Delhi\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension),\nAssistant Director General (Agricultural\nExtension), Zonal Project Directors,\nScientists and Officers from AED.\n3\n14 December, 2011 (F/N)\nConference Hall, II floor,\nMembers of the HPC, Deputy Director\nPerception of\nNASC, New Delhi\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension),\nstakeholders on KVK\nAssistant Director General (Agricultural\nExtension), Zonal Project Directors,\nScientists from ICAR, Vice-Chancellors\nand Directors of Extension from selected\nSAUs, Directors of selected ICAR\nInstitutes, Chairpersons of NGOs,\nOfficials from Corporate Sectors and\nFarmers.\n4\n14 December, 2011 (A/N) Conference Hall, II floor,\nMembers of HPC, Deputy Director\nImproving efficiency\nNASC, New Delhi\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension),\nof KVKs under NGOs\nAssistant Director General (Agricultural\nExtension), Zonal Project Directors,\nScientists from ICAR, Chairpersons of\nselected NGOs.\n5\n15 December, 2011 (F/N)\nConference Hall, II floor,\nMembers of HPC, Deputy Director\nMeeting of Chairpersons\nNASC, New Delhi\nGeneral (Agricultural Extension),\nof QRTs for strengthening\nAssistant Director General (Agricultural\nKVK system\nExtension), Zonal Project Directors,\nScientists fromICAR and Chairpersons\nof QRTs.\n6\n15 December, 2011 (A/N) Conference Hall, II floor,\nDr. S.

Main recommendations are given below:\n1. Almost all QRTs found that linkages of KVKs under NGOs with SAUs, ICAR are either\nmissing or weak.\n2. Holding of LMC (now SAC) meeting were crucial for development and proper functioning\nof the KVKs. It was recommended that Director of Extension Eduxation of SAUs/CAU\nshould act as Co-Chairman and hold meeting in the absence of VC as Chairman on scheduled\ndates.\n3. The DG, ICAR may take up the issue of ban on recruitment of staff in SAUs with the States\nwhere the ICAR funded scheme posts are vacant due to ban on recruitment.\n4. The selection committee constituted for recruitment should invariably have one\nrepresentative from AED of ICAR preferably the Zonal Project Director as member for all\nthe KVKs irrespective of category of Host Institutions (SAUs, ICAR and NGOs)\n5. QRT recommends that in case of SAUs, despite administrative and financial sanctions and\nrelease of funds by ICAR in time, the Universities/Comptroller did not release the money\nto KVKs.\n6. The financial power of Trining Organizer/Chief Training Organizer in SAUs may be\nenhanced to avoid undue delay in the implementation of the programmes.\n7. Impact of training and surveys should be got evaluated from an independent professional\ngroup for future improvements.\n8. The Director of Extension Education of SAU should play an important role in the monitoring\nand supervision of the technical programmes of KVKs in the State irrespective of their\nsponsorship by SAU/ICAR/NGOs.\nII QRT (2006): It was constituted under the Chairmanship of Mr. J.N.L. Srivastava, Former\nSecretary, DAC to review the performance of KVKs. Main recommendations are given below.\n1. All KVKs should be functionally linked with multi-crop/multi-dimensional research\ninstitutions for technical back up support.\n2. One more ZCU be established for NE Hilly region for effective monitoring and facilitation\nof KVK activities.\n3. The ZCU, which are now functioning under Plan project, may be shifted to Non Plan.\n4. The Programme Coordinator should be delegated with the financial power of that of\nAssociated Director of Research of ZARS.\n47\nAnnexures\n5. ICAR may provide grant to select KVKs to create facilities for post-harvest technology\nfor demonstrating the advantages of minimal processing facilities.\n6. All KVKs should be equipped with specialized Disease and Pest Diagnostic Laboratory\nfacilities.\n7. Special training programmes may be organized for project preparation and reporting\nsystems.\n8. Funds may be provided for purchase and install generator for uninterrupted functioning of\nKVK.\nIII QRTs (2011): Eight QRTs were constituted for ZPDs in 8 Zones\nAll eight QRTs conducted travel workshops and reviewed the progress of KVKs across the\ncountry. Based on the field visits; interactions with Programme Coordinators and staff of KVKs,\nfarmers, rural entrepreneurs, officials of line departments, Director(s) of Extension Education/Head\nof Departments, Vice Chancellors of SAUs and Zonal Project Directors; information collected\nfrom KVKs; and discussions among its members, QRTs observed/recommended the following:\n●A successful KVK is characterized by capable Programme Coordinator and committed staff\nwith administrative and financial support from the host institution.\n●Areas of success included technology assessment and refinement through on-farm trials,\npopularizing newer technologies/varieties through frontline demonstrations, training, various\nextension activities, and production of seeds, planting materials and bio-agents.\n●In their pursuit of reaching farmers, the KVKs adopted a number of innovative methods like\nFarmers’ Field School, innovative farmers approach, key informant/KVK expert approach,\nexposure visit and study tours, cluster area approach, participatory seed production, para-vet\ntechnicians and farmer friend, KVK volunteers and e-linkage has been also utilized for reaching\nto the farmers.\n●The present status of Transfer of Technology at the state level makes the KVKs to shoulder\nadditional responsibility along with providing technical expertise to a number of Centre/State\nsponsored programmes like ATMA, MGNREGA, RKVY, SGSY, NHM, NAIP etc. Involvement\nof KVKs in such large number of programmes is bound to enhance the visibility of the KVKs\nat zonal and national level, but at the same time affects the mandated activities of KVKs.\nInvolvement of KVKs should be restricted within the framework of mandated activities.\n●On the Intellectual Property front, KVKs can play a major role in facilitating identification and\nregistration of farmer’s varieties as well as innovative processes developed from time to time\nin crop and livestock sector.\n●The activities like training, demonstration, seed production, nursery raising, para-vet training,\npoultry farming, off season vegetables, production of organic inputs, cultivation of pulses, bee-\nkeeping, mushroom production, etc. are some of the technologies/initiatives which have impact\non the the socio-economic at the village level.\n●Each KVK should identify its niche area/flagship programme based on its strength and focus\nits activities to make wider impact.\n●Though the institutional training, especially vocational training should form core of the KVK\n48\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of Krishi Vigyan Kendra\ntraining programme, yet at several KVKs institutional long-term trainings need to be conducted.\nKVKs may look into this by developing appropriate modules.\n●Each KVK must assess and refine at least two technologies per year for recommending to the\ndistrict development departments for large scale adoption.\n●The staff strength needs re-examination in view of expanding mandate and nature and extent of\nnew tasks assigned. The new job requires constant change, diversification, and newer skills.\nThe emphasis on science plus (Research for Development) in research system is a new concept.\n●The farmers as well as different stakeholders are pursuing for establishing more and more\nKVKs probably because the farmers look towards KVK as a functional unit through which\nthey are getting several benefits.\n49\nAnnexures\nANNEXURE-IV\nChairman’s letter on interim recommendations\n50\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of Krishi Vigyan Kendra\n51\nAnnexures\nANNEXURE-V\nConstitution of Scientific Advisory Committee and its procedural guidelines\n1.

Such\nattempts ushered green, white, blue, yellow and gold revolutions in agriculture contributing\nsignificantly to enhance the production of foodgrains, oilseeds, milk, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables.\nHowever, ever increasing population and changing food habits, climate change, natural resource\nbase degradation and other such factors necessitate new strategies, instruments and innovations to\ncounter these challenges for accelerating agricultural growth and prosperity.\nEnhancing production and productivity and making it profitable/remunerative for farmers\nespecially large number of small holders, must assume the highest priority of farm sector. Agricultural\nsector is witnessing radical changes and challenges nationally and globally, like the demand for\nagricultural commodities in the wake of increased income and changing choices of the consumers.\nGlobalization has opened up uncommon opportunities for farmers to derive benefits. Agriculture\nhas now become extremely competitive and it is imperative to have paradigm shift in the way\nagriculture is practiced by resource starved farmers. Practicing agriculture demands to be innovative,\nnature friendly, relying on farmers’ wisdom and make use of modern development of science. India\nwith majority of farmers being small and marginal, the visible gains is expected to come by increasing\nthe productivity and income of this segment of population. Use of science and technology, knowledge\nempowerment and capacity building can enable farmers to make them competitive and induce\ninclusive growth. In emerging scenario, it would be very important to bring post-harvest technology\nand value addition, new market strategy, cool chain and agri-business approach up-front for higher\neconomic gains for farming community.\nSo far, the achievements in respect of agricultural growth and food production have been\nspectacular with self-sufficiency in foodgrains. One of the pillars for the success has been the\ndevelopment of sound institutions for technology development supported with institution model\nfor technology dissemination in the country. There is still untapped potential of currently available\nagricultural technologies, which can help mitigate the effects of shrinking cultivable land, scarcity\nof irrigation water, soil nutrient depletion, increasing biotic and abiotic stress etc. The farming has\nto be sustainable and profitable in different resource environment in order to bring in financial and\nlivelihood security for rural households.\nTo address issues related to technology dissemination in agriculture, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra\n(KVK), known also as Agriculture Science Centre, a grass root level scheme has been designed and\nnurtured by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for the past four decades. So far,\nICAR has established 630 KVKs across the country under different host organizations like State\nAgricultural Universities (SAUs), ICAR Institutes, Central Agricultural Universities (CAU)/Deemed\nUniversities (DUs), State Government, Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Non-Governmental\nOrganizations (NGOs).\n1. Prelude\n64\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nThe KVKs have played a crucial role in empowering the farmers since 1974 when the first\nKVK was established and proved their worth in addressing the needs of the stakeholders in the\nfollowing way:\n●Showcasing the frontier technologies\n●Capacity development of stakeholders\n●Front runner in technology application\n●Making available technological information and inputs\n●Practicing participatory approaches in planning, implementing, executing and evaluation\n●Pursuing assessment and refinement of technologies to suit different agro-climatic conditions\nHowever, for meeting new challenges, it is important to focus on conservation of natural\nresources, achieving higher productivity sustainability in agriculture, enhancing farmers income\nthrough bringing in farming to market value chain efficiency.\nKVK as an institution having played role in transforming agriculture, will have to play defining\nrole in economic empowerment and accelerating agricultural growth in the years to come. In order\nto make KVKs more efficient and vibrant, the High Power Committee (HPC) has prepared the\nKVK Management Guidelines. This will help in strengthening the KVK system leading to address\nthe specific problems and priorities in national and global perspective.\nThe Education Commission (1964-66) recommended that a vigorous effort be made to establish\nspecialized institutions to provide vocational education in agriculture and allied fields at the pre\nand post-matriculate levels to cater the training needs of a large number of boys and girls of rural\nareas. The Commission, further, suggested that such institutions be named as Agricultural\nPolytechnics. The recommendation of the Commission was thoroughly discussed during 1966-72\nby the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Planning Commission, ICAR and other\nallied institutions. Finally, the ICAR mooted the idea of establishing KVKs as innovative institutions\nfor imparting vocational training to the practicing farmers, school dropouts and field level extension\nfunctionaries. ICAR Standing Committee on Agricultural Education, in its meeting held in August,\n1973, observed that since the establishment of KVKs was of national importance which would help\nin accelerating the agricultural production and also in improving the socio-economic conditions of\nthe farming community, the assistance of all related institutions should be taken in implementing\nthis scheme. The ICAR, therefore, constituted a committee in 1973 headed by Dr. Mohan Singh\nMehta of Seva Mandir, Udaipur (Rajasthan), for working out a detailed plan for implementing this\nscheme. The Committee submitted its report in 1974.\nThe first KVK, on a pilot basis, was established in 1974 at Puducherry (Pondicherry) under the\nadministrative control of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), Coimbatore. In 1976-\n77, the Planning Commission approved the proposal of the ICAR to establish 18 KVKs during the\nFifth Five Year Plan. With the growing demand for more such KVKs, the Governing Body (GB) of\nthe ICAR approved 12 more KVKs in 1979 and they were established in the same year from\nAgricultural Produce Cess Fund (AP Cess Fund). Pending the clearance of Sixth Five -Year Plan\nscheme on KVK by the Planning Commission, the GB of the ICAR again approved 14 KVKs in\n1981, which were established during 1982--83 from AP Cess Fund.\nA High Level Evaluation Committee on KVK constituted by the ICAR in 1984, after thorough\nreview of the programme, strongly recommended for establishment of more KVKs in the country.\nKeeping this in view the Planning Commission approved to establish 44 new KVKs during the\nSixth Plan. Thus by the end of Sixth Plan, 89 KVKs had started functioning in the country.\nDuring the Seventh Plan, 20 new KVKs were established. The success of KVKs at many\nlocations created a great demand for establishment of more KVKs in the remaining districts of the\ncountry. Accordingly, the Planning Commission further approved 74 new KVKs to be established\nduring the period 1992-93. Again in the Eighth Plan (1992-97), 78 new KVKs were approved and\nthe same were established in the country, making the total number of functional KVKs 261 by the\nend of the Eighth Plan. The number of KVKs increased to 290 during Ninth Plan with the\nestablishment of 29 more KVKS.\nOn the occasion of the Independence Day Speech on 15th August, 2005 the Hon’ble Prime\nMinister of India announced that by the end of 2007 there should be one KVK in each of the rural\ndistricts of the country. This has taken the total number of KVKs to 551 at the end of Tenth Plan.\n2. Genesis and Growth\n66\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nAt present there are 630 KVKs, which include 428 under SAU and CAU, 51 under ICAR\nInstitute, 99 under NGOs, 35 under State Governments, and the remaining 17 under OEIs. (Appendix-\nXXXI)\nAll KVKs are working towards reducing the time lag between generation of technology at the\nresearch institution and its application in location specific farmer fields for increasing production,\nproductivity and net farm income on a sustained basis.\nAgricultural diversification is the key issue today for ensuring food and nutritional security.\nHence there is a need to move from a crop based approach to a farming system based approach with\nfarm, crop, resource, livestock and region specific technological solutions. In fact, crop and livestock\nhave co-evolved and co-existed and land is a basic factor for production of both. All land based\nhusbandries could contribute to agriculture, therefore a long-term view will have to be taken to\nharness the resources viz., soil, plant, nutrient, bio-resources, livestock, etc.\nIn the present context of increasing public concern for environment, globalization, household\nfood security and eco-regional imbalances, new directions in planning and application of technology\nby developing more effective linkages among the stakeholders. It would help to meet the future\nchallenges of growing demand for food production with egalitarian consideration as well as to\nenable the farmers cherish the pride and prestige of owning land and pursuing the profession of\nagriculture.\nThe Mohan Singh Mehta Committee (1974) enunciated the following three basic concepts of\nKVK:\n●The KVK will impart learning through work-experience and hence will be concerned with\ntechnical literacy, the acquisition of which does not necessarily require as a pre-condition for\nthe ability to read and write.\n●The KVK will impart training to only those extension workers who are already employed or to\nthe practicing farmers and fishermen. In other words, the KVK will cater to the needs of those\nwho are already employed or those who wish to be self-employed.\n●There will be no uniform syllabus for a KVK. The syllabus and programme of each KVK will\nbe tailored to the felt needs, natural resources and the potential for agricultural growth in that\nparticular area.\nThe Committee further suggested that the success of KVKs would depend upon adherence to\nthe following three basic principles.\n●Accelerating agricultural and allied productions in the operational area of the KVK should be\nthe prime goal;\n●Experiential learning i.e., “teaching by doing” and “learning by doing” should be the principal\nmethods of imparting skill training’ and\n●Training efforts should not be made to make economically good people better but the poor ones\ngood so as to raise the living conditions of the poorest of the poor.\nThe main idea was to influence the production system with social justice by creating a favourable\ncondition for the have-nots.\n3. Vision, Mission and Mandate\n68\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nKeeping the above in view, the Vision, Mission and Mandate of KVK are tailored as follows:\n3.1 Vision\nScience and technology-led growth leading to enhanced productivity, profitability and\nsustainability of agriculture.\n3.2 Mission\nFarmer-centric growth in agriculture and allied sectors through application of appropriate\ntechnologies in specific agro-ecosystem perspective.\n3.3 Mandate\nTechnology Assessment and Demonstration for its wider Application and to enhance Capacity\nDevelopment (TADA-CD).\nTo implement the mandate effectively through creation of awareness about improved agricultural\ntechnologies, the following activities be defined for each KVK.\n(i) On-farm testing to assess the location specificity of agricultural technologies under various\nfarming systems.\n(ii) Out scaling of farm innovations through frontline demonstration to showcase the specific\nbenefits/worth of technologies on farmers’ fields.\n(iii) Capacity development of farmers and extension personnel to update their knowledge and\nskills in modern agricultural technologies and enterprises.\n(iv) Work as Knowledge and Resource Centre for improving overall agricultural economy in\nthe operational area.\n(v) Conduct frontline extension programmes and provide farm advisories using ICT and other\nmedia on varied subjects of interest to farmers\n(vi) Data documentation, characterization and strategic planning of farming practices\nKVK, while acting as a single window Agricultural Technology Information Centre (ATIC),\nshould produce quality technology related inputs/products (seeds, planting materials, bio-agents,\nlivestock, fingerlings etc,) and make them available to farmers. Besides, identify and document\nselected farmer-led innovations and converge with ongoing schemes and programmes within the\nmandate of KVK.\nKVK scheme is in implementation in the country since Forth Five Year Plan. There are many\norganizations involved in the implementation of KVKs in the country. Based on the experiences\ngained over the years, certain reinforcements are envisaged in the design and structure of the scheme\nfor its effective implementation across the country.\n4.1 Design\nKVK is designed to have expertise in three areas (a) technology assessment, refinement and\ndemonstration to evolve location and site specific need based and viable technologies, (b) training\nand capacity development of farmers, rural youth, extension functionaries, and other stakeholders,\nand (c) serve as knowledge and resource centre (Fig-1).\n4. Design, Structure and Strategy\n4.2 Structure: Technologies developed through NARS need proper assessment and refinement\nfor a particular location, before disseminating on a larger scale through demonstrations. Further,\nthe skills related to these technologies are to be transferred to the clientele properly through training\nprogrammes. In addition, good quality seeds, planting materials, livestock strains, bio-products etc.\nhave to be produced and supplied to the farmers for the effective adoption. Technologies also reach\nthe masses through various extension activities like kisan mela, publications, field days, seminars,\nworkshops, farmers visit to KVKs etc. KVKs undertake all these activities with the aim and objective\nof achieving sustainable growth in agriculture and its allied sectors in their respective districts.\nFig. 1: Design of KVK\n70\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nKVK is an integral part of NARS, which aims at the development and promotion of location\nspecific technology modules in agriculture and its allied enterprises through Technology Assessment,\nRefinement and Demonstration. The functional structure of KVK to achieve its mandate is presented\nin Fig 2.\nFig. 2: Functional structure of KVK\n71\nDesign, Structure and Strategy\n4.3 Strategy\nThe NARS needs to respond to changing trends of agricultural scenario viz., increasing pressure\non natural resources, increasing biotic and abiotic stress, demand for diversification and generation\nof new technologies, input use efficiency (water, nutrients, energy), profitability in farming through\npost harvest processing, quality human resource development, enhancing operational efficiency of\nthe system, mitigating the climate change impact, improving quality seed availability and factor\nproductivity.\nIt is proposed to consider productivity, production and income of the farmers in totality for\npursuing sustainable agriculture through the following strategy:\n(a) Remunerative agriculture: Increasing productivity & production, management of post\nharvest losses, value chain for increasing farmer’s income and ultimately system sustainability.\n(b) Climate smart agriculture: Conservation of soil & water, bio-conservation, reducing\nenvironmental pollution, climate resilience, and increasing productivity and production of green\nhouse/protected cultivation.\n(c) Food and dietary diversification agriculture: Removing malnutrition, nutritional disorders,\nyear round house hold food security, stable and sustainable food supplies, improving livelihood at\ngrass root level through convergence of all schemes for eliminating hunger and poverty.\nIn order to achieve the above, KVKs would further strengthen the following activities:\n(i) Creation of database: Statistics of district agriculture and its allied sectors as well as\ntechnological options using appropriate tools and techniques of ICT,\n(ii) Action plan on technological interventions: Based on farmer’s problems and priorities\nin agro-ecosystem perspective,\n(iii) Entrepreneurship development: The HRD, group approach and secondary agriculture,\n(iv) Delivery of technological inputs: Production and supply of quality seeds, planting materials\nand livestock strains, and\n(v) Convergence: Sharing and judicious use of resources with other schemes/agencies.\nKVKs have witnessed several changes in their functions over the years. Accordingly their\nfunctional definition also has radically got refined so as to meet the new challenges in agriculture.\nKVKs are grass root level organizations meant for application of technology through assessment,\nrefinement and demonstration of proven technologies under different ‘micro farming’ situations in\na district” (Das, 2007). It should be clearly understood that transfer of technology is not a primary\nfunction of KVKs. The KVKs on the other hand will assess and refine (if needed) the newly released\ntechnologies, demonstrate the proven ones and train farmers and extension functionaries on the\nsame. Hence it is a Frontline Extension System.\n5.1 Accountability: It is compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and\naccurately on performance results vis-à-vis mandated roles and/or plans. This may require a careful,\neven legally defensible, demonstration that the work is consistent with the defined terms.\n5.2 Adaptive research: It is essentially research done for solving a local problem and uses\nresearch information generated by applied research to tailor appropriate technology for specific\nareas and defined groups of farmers. This research is primarily conducted to test the performance of\nthe technology under farmers’ condition, which is different from the condition of the research stations.\nIt identifies existing inputs or practices that might help to solve major problems of farmers in a\ndefined area and therefore it is essentially a problem-solving research.\n5.3 Adoption gap: It is the gap between the level of recommendation and the extent of adoption\nof recommendations. The gap in adoption of technology is computed in percentage by the following\nformula:\nWhere, R= Total obtainable score and A = Total obtained score.\n5.4 Agro-ecosystem: It refers to grouping of elements in relation to agriculture and ecology\nwithin a boundary and analysis of functional relationship of these elements to each other as an\nindividual or as a group to assess the potential of the system as a whole. That means it is composed\nof the total complex of the crops/animals in an area together with overall environment and as\nmodified by management practices.\n5.5 Capacity building: Capacity building is the ability to perform appropriate tasks effectively\nand sustainably. UNDP (1997) defined capacity building as the ability of an individual or organization\nto perform functions effectively, efficiently and sustainably.\n5.6 Case study: It is a detailed report of the success or failure of a project or an intervention\nhighlighting the background, major milestones, turning points and the overall achievements. A\nsuccessful or unique case can be studied over a larger population to establish the effect/spread of\nthe technology/process implemented. Such cases can be used as study/training materials to draw\nlessons from the experiences.\n5. Operational Terminology\n73\nOperational Terminology\n5.7 Coordination: It is synergizing the efforts of individuals and groups for accomplishment\nof set objectives. For smooth running of an enterprise coordination is necessary within the\norganization, as well as with other/outside organizations.\n5.8 Data: Data usually means raw, unevaluated facts, figures, symbols, objects, events etc. A\ndatabase is a structured collection of records. A computer database relies upon software to organize\nthe storage of data. The software models the database structure into what are known as database\nmodels.\n5.9 Diagnosis: Implies studying farmers circumstances and farmers practices in order to\nunderstand the farming system and its interactions, identify the possible productivity problems, and\nbegin to develop hypotheses on possible solutions on what?, how? and why?.\n5.10 Exhibition: Exhibition is a planned and systematic display of real objects, specimens,\nmodels, charts and posters presented to public view for instruction, judging a competition, advertising\nor entertainment. It helps to create awareness, develop interests and stimulate action amongst the\npublic. It accommodates both exhibits and display. Displays use two dimensional or flat materials\nlike pictures, photograph, chart, posters etc, while exhibits tend to use more three dimensional\nmaterials like real objects, specimens and models.\n5.11 Farmers’ Field School (FFS): As the name suggests Farmers Field School is a school for\nthe farmers outside the classrooms and on the farms. It operates with the principles of non-formal\neducation and most of the sessions and contents based on the adult learning principles. It seeks to\nempower people to solve their field problems actively by fostering participation, interaction, dialogue,\njoint decision-making, self-confidence and self-determination.\n5.12 Farm management: It deals with the business principles and principles of farming with\nan objective of obtaining the maximum possible return from the farm as a unit under a sound\nfarming programme.\n5.13 Farming system: It represents an appropriate combination of farm enterprises viz., cropping\nsystems, livestock, fisheries, forestry, poultry and the same means available to the farmer to raise\nthem for profitability. It interacts adequately with environment without dislocating the ecological\nand socio-economic balance on one hand and attempts to meet the national goals on the other.\n5.14 Field day: It is an activity held at the demonstration site at an appropriate stage to share\nthe performance of the technology demonstrated with the potential users of the technology and\nother stakeholders.\n5.15 Field visit: It is a planned activity, which can take place to an intended field either having\nsuccessful technology models or uniqueness or having certain kind of adversity, which needs\nattention. It gives exposure to the participants to the real life situation and also provides an idea\nabout the possible solutions to the problems.\n5.16 Frontline demonstration: It is the concept of field demonstration evolved by the Indian\nCouncil of Agricultural Research with the inception of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds during\nmid eighties to show the performance of new varieties including recommended production\ntechnologies on farmers’ fields under real farm situations for increasing productivity and returns.\nThese demonstrations conducted under the close supervision of scientists of the NARS are called\n74\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nfrontline demonstrations because the technologies are demonstrated by the scientists themselves\nbefore being fed into the main extension system of the State Department of Agriculture. Frontline\ndemonstrations can include demonstrations on methods/practices and secondly the result\ndemonstrations in which technology components will be taken up. The demonstrations are further\nclassified as (a) Single practice demonstration—It includes demonstration of a single practice\nthat is compared with the existing farmers practice. For example variety, nutrient management, pest\nmanagement etc. and (b) Composite demonstration—It includes demonstration of combination\nof improved practices like improved seed, fertilizer, irrigation etc. to show the production potential\nof the technologies as compared to farmers practices.\n5.17 Human Resource Development (HRD): It refers to planned approach of developing\nhuman capabilities, talents that contributes to growth of all aspects of people in terms of awareness,\nknowledge, skills, competence, confidence, maturity and continuous adjustment with changing\nenvironment.\n5.18 Information: Collection of data itself is not information. When data are processed for\nconveying some meaning, it is called information. Information is data that has been processed into\na form that is meaningful to the recipient and is real or perceived value in current or prospective\nactions or decisions.\n5.19 Innovation: An innovation is an idea, practice or object that is perceived as new by an\nindividual or group of individuals.\n5.20 Impact analysis: It is an assessment of end results of a project with reference to the\nmandate/objectives set in the scheme for getting information about past or on-going activities as a\nbasis for modifying or re-designing future strategies. It is to be done based on the principle of\nrelationship between the means and effects of the scheme. This means and effects linkage can be\nexpressed in terms of an ‘If…Then’ relationship. If inputs are provided then outputs will be produced,\nif outputs are produced then outcome (purpose) will be achieved, if purpose is achieved then the\nimpact (goal) should be attained.\nIt should be noted that the timely availability of inputs like goods, funds, services, manpower,\ntechnology, infrastructure and resources are necessary and sufficient to achieve the outputs; and the\noutputs should be necessary and sufficient to achieve the outcome (purpose), whereas the\nachievement of the purpose will be necessary but not sufficient to achieve the impact, it requires\ncomplementary effects of other related schemes and policies of the government.\n5.21 Knowledge: Collection of information itself is not knowledge. Knowledge is the retained\ninformation concerning facts, concepts and relationship. It is defined as expertise and skills acquired\nby a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject,\nwhat is known in a particular field or in total; facts and information or awareness or familiarity\ngained by experience of a fact or situation.\n5.22 Knowledge management: It seeks to understand the way in which knowledge is created,\nused and shared within organizations. A significant part of Knowledge Management theory is the\nDIKW model, which places Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom into an increasingly useful\npyramid.\n75\nOperational Terminology\n5.23 On Farm Trials (OFT): It is testing of different technological options in farmer’s fields,\nunder farmers’ management keeping the farmers’ practice as one of the technological options.\n5.24 Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA): It is a way of enabling local (rural and urban)\npeople to analyze their living conditions, to share the outcomes and to plan their activities. It is a\nhanding over the stick to the insider in methods and action. The outsider’s role is that of a catalyzer,\na facilitator and convenor of processes within a community, which is prepared to alter their situation.\n5.25 Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA): It is a systematic, semi-structured activity conducted\non-site by a multidisciplinary team with the aim of quickly and efficiently acquiring new information\nand hypotheses about rural life and rural resources.\n5.26 Stakeholders: An agency, organisation, group or individual who has a direct or indirect\ninterest in the project/programme, or who affects or is affected positively or negatively by the\nimplementation and outcome of it. Primary stakeholders are the main intended beneficiaries of a\nproject.\n5.27 Success story: A unique experience of the farmer or group of farmers in pursuing a\nsuccessful practice/process or model may prove to be a successful case for learning for others and\ncan be termed as success story.\n5.28 Sustainable development: Sustainability refers to the successful management of resources\nto satisfy changing human needs, while maintaining or enhancing the quality of environment and\nconserving natural resources. The KVK staff while formulating their programs should focus on\nmaintaining the sustainability of the micro farming system in their districts.\n5.29 Technology: Technology is any systematic knowledge applicable in a particular area in\norder to achieve some values. Technology involves application of science and knowledge to practical\nuse. Agricultural Technology is a complex blend of materials, processes and knowledge.\n5.30 Technology Assessment and Refinement (TAR): It refers to a set of procedures whose\npurpose is to develop recommendations for a particular agro-climatic situation/location through\nassessment and refinement of recently released technology through participatory approach. It refers\nto the process or a set of activities before taking up new scientific information for its dissemination\nin a production system. On Farm Trial (OFT) is a tool to carry out technology assessment and\nrefinement. The OFTs conducted by the KVKs are different from agronomic and other research\ntrials. TAR has three components viz., technology testing, adaptation and integration.\n5.31 Technology assessment: Technology assessment is conceptualized as finding out a more\nprofitable and sustainable option than the existing one in a given environment. To find out such an\noption, one or two new technological options or practices are tested against the best existing option.\n5.32 Technology backstopping: It refers to technology and technological input support by\nNARS to the KVKs, which can further extend it to the development departments and organizations\nworking in agriculture and allied sectors.\n5.33 Technology refinement: If assessed technologies are not performing satisfactorily or\npartially performing to solve the problem, then the technology refinement can be taken up with\nnecessary modification to suit the local conditions of the farmers in respect of socio-economic and\nbio-physical conditions.\n76\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n5.34 Technology week: It is an extension programme, which aims to reorient KVK premises\nas Farmers Stop for appropriate and effective dissemination of latest technologies.\n5.35 Training: It is the acquisition of knowledge, skills and competencies for bringing desirable\nchange in the attitude and behaviour of the individuals to perform specific activity in a given\nenvironment.\n5.36 Training Needs Assessment (TNA): It is a systematic, objective determination of training\nneeds of individuals through three types of analysis namely organization/community, job and person\nanalysis.\n5.37 Training evaluation: It is a process by which the desired behavioural changes - knowledge,\nskills and attitudes due to training are measured against set of objectives/standards. This can be\nconducted by training institution, participants (trainees) and participating institution (sponsoring\nagency).\n5.38 Vocational training: It refers to long-term vocation-based and skill oriented training for\nrural youth, farm women, school drop-outs etc. in agriculture and allied activities for income\ngeneration and self-employment.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF KVK SYSTEM\nPART - II\nThe authority of the implementation of the KVK scheme is vested with the ICAR, New Delhi.\nThe ICAR is a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and has full authority\nto perform all acts and issue such directions as may be considered necessary, incidental or conducive\nto the attainment of the objectives enunciated in the KVK scheme.\nThe Secretary, DARE and Director General, ICAR is the Principal Executive Officer of the\nICAR Society. He is supported by Deputy Director General (Agricultural Extension) for planning,\nexecution and monitoring of KVK Scheme. The organizational set up of the KVK system is depicted\nin Fig-4.\n6.

Further, host organization should\nstrengthen the communication strategy by involving innovative and progressive farmers to\ncreate public awareness for owning the KVK by different stakeholders in the district.\n6.1.11 Closure of KVK: The ICAR shall provide grant for the KVK through its host organization\nas per the financial aid approved under the KVK Scheme by the Government of India from time to\ntime. Grant should be utilized by the host organization exclusively for the intended purpose of the\nKVK Scheme on items for which it is sanctioned by the ICAR. Further, as per the Agreement/MoU,\nthe host organization agrees with ICAR to work together in implementing Vision, Mission and\nMandate of KVK.\nThus, KVK shall be responsible for doing mandated work and thereby significantly contribute\ntowards agricultural production in the district/area of operation. In the event of an unsatisfactory\nprogress of work of the KVK as assessed by the ICAR from time to time, ICAR will have the\nfollowing actions:\n●Stop immediately the release of further grants to the KVK for its running/operation/continuing.\n●In the event of unsatisfactory progress of work of any KVK, as assessed by the ICAR from\ntime-to-time, the ICAR shall reserve its right to terminate/close such KVK under any host\norganization by giving six months advance notice for the same.

Having been recognized as the only scientific\ninstitution at the district level in agriculture and allied sectors, every KVK has to work in harmony\nand partnership with many organizations for achieving its goals and objectives, which necessitate\nfunctional linkages with all development agencies/organizations and other stakeholders, especially\nthe farmers.\n9.1 Coordination between KVK and ATMA\n●In a true partnership mode, the KVK should function as a frontline extension system, whereas,\nATMA to act as a field extension agency for large scale technology dissemination/adoption. As\nsuggested in this report that while KVKs would work in a “cluster mode”, the district level\nATMA functionaries could take lead in out-scaling of successful technologies/innovations\nthrough large-scale demonstrations and further verification/validation.\n●While KVK would have major responsibilities for technology verification and its upscaling,\nATMA could play an important role for large scale dissemination through involvement of mass\nmedia (ICT, Radio, TV etc), farmers’ organizations, NGOs and private sector. It could also be\nthe major player for public awareness and large scale supply of technology linked inputs. On\nthe contrary, KVK should assume specific role of ATIC through production of seeds, planting\nmaterials, livestock materials, value added products, publications, prototypes of small\nimplements, etc.\n●The Project Director, ATMA and his team should plan periodical joint visits to the cluster\nvillages of KVKs for gaining first-hand knowledge on new technologies being demonstrated\nso that activities could be initiated under ATMA for large-scale disseminations. Apart from\ncluster villages, the problems or issues noticed by Project Director, ATMA and his staff in other\nvillages could be brought to the notice of KVK staff to ensure necessary follow-up.\n●There should be an effective coordination mechanism between Chief Scientist-cum-Head of\nKVK and Project Director of ATMA through a joint coordination committee, which must meet\nmore frequently. Also the ATMA should participate regularly in the SAC meetings of KVKs.\n●At the district level, ATMA and KVK should have joint meetings on the pattern of Central\nLevel pre-kharif and pre-rabi workshops in which all other stakeholders be also invited.\n●ATMA functionaries should support and actively participate in “Technology Week” being\norganized by KVKs that comprises of live demonstrations, exhibitions, ensuring availability of",

Convergence and Linkage\n112\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●While State Agricultural Universities/ICAR Institutes/NGOs hosting KVKs would have major\nresponsibility for effective functioning of KVKs in the State, the concerned departments of\nagriculture/horticulture/animal husbandry/fisheries assume greater ownership role so as to have\nmultiplying effect of both sides i.e research and development departments.\n9.2 Convergence/linkages among KVKs and other Government Schemes\nFor effective coordination and convergence, there is need to draw a silver line for defined\nresponsibilities so that there is obvious clarity in functions and roles. The convergence has to be in\nterms of sharing of knowledge, resources and experiences and recommends the following guidelines.\n●KVK should indentify and initiate action on the priority areas indicated in the Comprehensive\nDistrict Agriculture Plan (CDAP).\n●KVK must harness available ICT programmes of development departments and Ministries (eg.\nSMS Portal, Common Service Centres, Video-Conferencing facilities of NIC etc.) through\neffective networking.\n●Greater involvement of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department would help KVKs in\npursuing Integrated Farming Systems approach.\n●Scientists-extension functionaries-farmers interface should be frequently be organized by KVKs\nto reaffirm the utility of results under local conditions so as to out-scale technologies.\n●The field-functionaries of NGOs working in agriculture and allied sector have to be treated as\nimportant partners especially for their capacity building efforts for technology transfer.\n●To build capacities of rural youth as technology agents, through vocational training programme,\nit will be essential to link them to bankable projects. Hence, for effective services to farmers on\ncustom hiring basis/out-sourcing, linkages with credit extending organizations will be highly\nessential.\nIn order to coordinate and monitor effectively the above suggested areas of convergence, the\nCommittee is of the view that ICAR should set up with approval of its President (Minister of\nAgriculture) Joint-Coordination Committee at the national level and also ensure establishment of\nsimilar Joint-Coordination Committees at State and District levels as specified in Appendix -XXX.\nAssessment, refinement and demonstration of technology/products, and capacity building of\ndifferent stakeholders to facilitate agricultural growth in the district is the mandate of the KVK. To\nachieve this, KVK carry out on farm testing, frontline demonstrations and training. KVK provides\na platform to NARS for showcasing agricultural technologies/products at the grass root level. KVK\nalso functions as resource and knowledge centre and provides technology and the required materials\nlike seeds, planting materials, literature and other technology products to support uptake of\ntechnologies.\nThere is a growing realization that specialized competences in the KVK staff are required to\nharness the distinct opportunities in the district.\nKVK works in clusters of 4-5 villages for testing and demonstration of technologies. However,\nother activities like training, awareness, etc., are conducted keeping the entire district as the domain\nof the KVK.\nWith limited scientific manpower, extension aimed at development is not be possible by the\nKVK and convergence with line departments may enhance the effectiveness.\n10.1 Domain of activities\n●Creation of database on the district profile based on the secondary data.\n●KVK should work in a cluster villages approach.\n●Base-line data of the cluster villages need to be collected through PRA and other participatory\nmethods and it should specifically reflect on problems related to agriculture and allied sectors.\nThe progress thus, made be documented every year and be compared with the base-line data\nfor assessing the impact of KVK interventions.\n●Address district-specific needs in Agriculture, Horticulture, Fisheries, Livestock, Poultry, and\nAgro-forestry, by identifying and prioritizing problems.\n●Extent, severity, importance and frequency of the problems in the existing farming conditions\nshould be considered as main criteria for identification and prioritization.\n●Identify primary and secondary factors/biotic and abiotic causes of each prioritized problem\nand plan for appropriate interventions.\n●Each Scientist (SMS) in KVK should address at least one most relevant issue of the area.\n●Prepare work plan for cluster of villages with well-defined outputs/deliverables. The yearly\naction plan should aim at tackling each prioritized problem through selecting suitable\ntechnologies, on-farm tests, frontline demonstrations, capacity development, frontline extension\nprogrammes, supply of technology related inputs etc.\n10. Scientific and Technical\n114\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\n●Identify, document and validate important farmer led innovations.\n●Conduct need-based capacity development related activities through specific technology modules\nand methods/techniques and bring out training manuals in local language.\n●Create technology agents through vocational programmes so as to serve as service providers to\nfarmers at the grass-root level.\n●Emphasize on activities related to value-chain concept from producer to consumer.\n●Organize skill and entrepreneurship training to rural youth/farm women/progressive farmers\nfor higher production of technological products.\n●Develop quality mother orchard of major fruit crops in the district.\n●Establish permanent Technology Demonstration Units, Integrated Farming System Units and\nTechnology Cafeteria.\n●Produce technological inputs and products like seeds/seedlings/livestock/bio-products etc., using\nRevolving Fund, in order to ensure their availability to farmers and other stakeholders.\n●Plan and execute appropriate off-campus programmes on capacity development.\n●Design and implement innovative extension strategies for individual, group and mass awareness\nabout technology related to prioritized problems. Use ICT tools and techniques like e-extension,\nweb-based technology content including modules and capsules, e-farmers, v-KVK and KVK-\nnet for reaching the unreached for knowledge empowerment and technology dissemination.\n●Aim for specific targeted programmes like soil, water and plant testing and issuance of soil\nhealth cards to farmers in cluster villages.\n●Encourage participatory approach for production of seeds and planting materials by farmers at\nthe village level.\n●Document significant achievements in the form of case studies/success stories as per the merits\nof the technology. At least one success story/case study per year be brought out and submitted\nto the ZPD.\n●Prepare yearly budget estimate on realistic basis.\n●For resource augmentation, converge with other central and state government programmes/\nschemes related to agriculture and allied sectors.\nThe detailed operational guidelines are provided below for effective planning, implementation\nand monitoring of these activities.\n10.1.1 District profile\nEach KVK should maintain a data base on the district profile viz., blocks/villages, demography\nincluding farmers (small, marginal and large), livestock population, weather data, distribution of\nland, area under major crops, production and productivity trends of crops, livestock, fisheries and\nallied sectors, home-scale enterprises and socio economic profile. Besides, details of inputs,\nmarketing, processing, extension service providers etc., may also be maintained in the database.\n115\nScientific and Technical\n10.1.2\nSelection of cluster villages\nThe KVK should work in cluster villages approach wherein 4-5 villages covering farm families\ndominated by small and marginal farmers selected preferably from different agro-ecosystems and\ncontinue work in the selected cluster(s) for 3 years with phased out strategy to implement similar\nactivities across the district by moving to new cluster of villages for another 3 year cycle\n10.1.3 Base-line data of the cluster villages (collection, analysis and documentation)\nThe information and data related to agriculture and allied activities of the village need to be\ncollected using participatory tools and techniques. When the data is collected through participatory\napproaches, the factuality and accuracy of data needs to be answered through triangulation. The\ndata needs to be collected every year and it should be compared with the base-line data for assessing\nthe impact of KVK interventions.\n●Secondary data about the villages must be collected before entering the village.\n●The base-line data should reflect on problems related to agriculture and allied sectors.\n●Prioritization of the problems needs to be done through participatory approaches.\n●The criteria to be followed for problem identification and prioritization are the extent, severity,\nimportance and frequency of the problem in the existing farming conditions.\n●Identifying primary and secondary causes/biotic and abiotic causes of each prioritized problem\nis necessary to plan for appropriate interventions.\n●Share the base-line data with the line departments to facilitate appropriate convergence.\n10.1.4 Interventions\n●Action plan must aim at tackling each prioritized problem through on farm trials, frontline\ndemonstrations, training, extension programmes and supply of technological inputs etc.,\n●Mobilize convergence with other ministries/departmental programmes.\n10.1.6 Clientele coverage\n●All stakeholders in the cluster villages are treated as clientele. This includes farmers, farm\nwomen, rural youth, extension functionaries, formal and informal institutions in the district.\n●All stakeholders who avail advisory and diagnostic services at KVK are treated as clientele for\nKVK activities.\n10.1.7 Technology assessment and refinement\nCrops, animals and their environments are highly complex systems with a multitude of variables\nthat change from location to location in any district of India. Due to this complexity, practices\noptimized for a research station might not be so successful when transferred to farmer field. Though\nthe new location anywhere in KVK district may appear similar to that of research station, there may\nbe an undefined key limitation or combination of minor but different limitations that constrain\npotential production. This necessitates for assessment and refinement of technology.\n116\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nOn-farm trial (OFT) is the tool for technology assessment and refinement. This activity is\nmainly focused to test developed technologies which might help to solve the most important and\nwidely spread problems of group of farmers in a defined area in a farming system perspective.\nOFTs are normally planned, managed and evaluated by farmers themselves with facilitative role of\nKVK scientists through active participation and management.\nTechnology assessment\n●Identified problems and related available technological options may be discussed at different\nplatforms i.e. district, SAU and zonal level before its testing.\n●Technology assessment is conceptualized as finding out a more profitable and sustainable option\nthan the existing one in a given environment. To find out such an option, one or two new\ntechnological options or practices are tested against the farmers practice and the recommended\npractice.\nTechnology refinement\n●If assessed technologies are not performing satisfactorily in solving the problem, then the\ntechnology refinement can be taken up with necessary modification to suit the local conditions\nof the farmers taking in to consideration their socio-economic and bio-physical conditions.\nSpecial features\n●The OFT aims to address the problems that are important and faced by a large number of\nfarmers in the area.\n●Choice of technological options must be based on various factors prevailing in the farmer’s\nsituation to increase the production in selected crops and livestock. Emphasis must be given to\ntest one technology at a time in order to convince farmers on the utility of technological options\nto solve the problem and to ensure adoption of the technology by the farming community.\n●Due importance is to be given to conduct the trials with farmers’ perspective, participation,\nmanagement in farmers’ fields.\n●All the essential/required observations have to be recorded in each and every trial. The collected\ndata are to be processed, analyzed and documented for drawing recommendations as well as\nfor reference.\n●Successful technological options must be up-scaled through frontline demonstrations in\nsuccessive seasons in the same location as well as in other parts of the district.\n●The FLD, training, mass media utilization etc., are to be used to disseminate the best technologies.\nFurther, feedback information on each technology tested through these trials is to be recorded\nfor further modification or refinement, if any.\n117\nScientific and Technical\nSteps involved in planning and conducting of OFT\n●Site characterization (District, block, village, ecosystem analysis of village)\n●Problem statement (problem analysis like characteristics, contributing factors etc, management\nstrategies like farmer practice, proven technology options etc., technology interventions etc.)\n●Planning and experimentation (technical programme like year, season, title, objectives, location,\nreplications, plot size, technological options, arrangement of seeds/planting materials/technology\nobservations to be recorded, methodology etc.)\n●Results and discussion (performance of technology, database and analysis, reports and\ndocumentation etc)\n●Follow up action (group meetings, training, field days, publications, radio talks, TV talks etc)\n●Feedback (farmers perception about the technological attributes like problem solving,\nunderstandability, practicability, cost effectiveness, profitability, sustainability, compatibility,\naccessibility, satisfaction etc)\n●Conclusion (salient recommendations)\nPoints to be observed while recording data\n●Data in respect of all field trials including failed trials should be reported. Data are to be\ncollected in collaboration with the participating farmers.\n●If the yield of any particular plot or a group of plots was affected due any problem, reasons for\nthe same should be recorded.\n●Similarly extent of damage due to abnormal conditions like hailstorm, drought, flood etc. during\ncrop season, should also be recorded very carefully and interpreted appropriately.\nData sheet: Data sheet would vary based on the topic and discipline of study. However, the\nfinding of the trials should reflect on the following indicators so that compatibility of the assessed/\nrefined technologies to the farming situations can be ascertained and acceptable to the participating\nfarmers:\n●Stability in production/productivity\n●Use of internal resources, rather than purchased inputs\n●Economic viability\n●Replicability of the refined technologies in similar farming situation\n●Use of appropriate statistical tools to measure the finding\nFeedback: Farmers’ reaction on the performance of technologies may be recorded on (i) socio-\ncultural compatibility, (ii) compatibility with existing farming systems, (iii) divisibility of technology,\n(iv) simplicity/complexity, (v) compatibility with internal resources of the households, (vi) easy\navailability of related inputs/materials, (vii) element of risk involved and (viii) viability. These\nobservations will help in assessing the acceptability of the technologies by the farming community.\n118\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nReporting format of OFT\nCrop/\nFarming\nProblem Title No. of Technology Parameters\nData\nResults\nFeedback\nAny\nJustification\nenterprise situation definition\nof\ntrials\nAssessed\nof\non\nassessment\nfrom refinement\nfor\nOFT\nassessment\nthe\nthe\ndone\nrefinement\nparameter\nfarmer\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n(Format Contd.)\nTechnology Assessed/Refined\n*Production per unit\nNet Return (Profit) in ` /unit\nBC Ratio\n13\n14\n15\n16\nTechnology option 1 (Farmer’s practice)\nTechnology option 2\nTechnology option 3\n*Field crops – kg/ha, * for horticultural crops -= kg/t/ha, * milk and meat – litres or kg/animal, * for mushroom\nand vermi compost kg/unit area. ** details of the technology assessed\nDetails of each OFT to be furnished in the following format separately along with raw data as\nper the separate proforma provided\n– Title of Technology assessed/refined\n– Problem Definition\n– Details of technologies selected for assessment/refinement\n– Source of technology\n– Production system and thematic area\n– Performance of the technology with performance indicators\n– Final recommendation for micro level situation\n– Constraints identified and feedback for research\n– Process of farmers participation and their reaction\nPoints to be considered in conducting OFTs\n●OFTs are being replicated under different farming situations in various micro locations of the\ndistrict with suitable numbers of treatments.\n●Results are being obtained on different parameters both quantitative and qualitative jointly by\nscientists and farmers.\n●Suitable options based on qualitative and quantitative results under the farmers’ perspective\nwith their own perceptions would be suggested from the available alternatives.\n●Sustainability under farmers’ socio-economic, agro-ecological and infrastructural situations\nare the major criteria for the final recommendations regarding suitability of technology tested.\n●The results and the variations from the research station recommendations are to be communicated\nback to the research system after further refinement in technology on the specific parameters.\n119\nScientific and Technical\n●Technologies, which failed in assessment stage itself or after refinement, too have to be\ncommunicated back to research system as not suitable for the district. This will prevent\nduplication of assessment efforts and prevent loss to farmer community in the district.\n10.1.8 Frontline demonstrations\nFrontline demonstration (FLD) is the concept of field demonstration evolved by the ICAR\nwith the inception of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds during mid eighties to show the\nperformance of new varieties including recommended production technologies on farmers’ fields\nunder real farm situations for increasing productivity and returns.\nObjectives\n●To demonstrate production potential of newly released varieties and proven technologies of\nagriculture and allied sectors from NARS in the farmers’ fields under different agro-eco\nsituations.\n●To generate data on factors contributing towards productivity and production enhancement\nunder various farming situations.\n●To utilize these demonstrations for training of farmers and extension personnel and generating\nfeedback.\nFeatures of FLD\n●Proven technologies/newly released varieties are selected for demonstration\n●The target group of FLDs is both farmers and extension personnel\n●Organized in a cluster approach involving participating farmers\n●Conducted under the supervision of the scientists/specialists\n●The organizing centre provides mainly critical inputs and training\nProcess of conducting demonstration\n●Identified problems need to be discussed in SAC/Zonal Workshops for selecting suitable\ntechnologies for demonstration.\n●Source of identified technology for demonstration should be ascertained\n●Location of demonstration (District, block, village) to be spelt out\n●Planning and layout (situation analysis, constraint analysis, target farmers, characteristics of\ntechnology, timely availability of critical inputs)\n●Implementation (year, season, arrangement of critical inputs, group meetings, training on\ntechnical know-how and do-how, field visits during critical stage of operations, field days and\nmass media coverage)\n●Results (Data analysis and performance of technology)\n●Feedback (Perception of farmers and extension personnel on performance of technology)\n●Documentation and reporting\n120\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nChecklist for FLD\n●Cluster approach in selecting area/village.\n●Easily approachable sites for demonstrations.\n●Receptive, willing and cooperative farmers.\n●Pre-demonstration training of farmers .\n●Ensuring participation of extension personnel\n●Identification of proven technologies.\n●Critical inputs may be provided by implementing centre.\n●Proper layout is essential with farmers’ practice as control.\n●Regular visits during critical stages.\n●Field day and Publicity\n●Feedback and relevant data.\nReporting format of FLD\na.

Farmers and extension personnel are the important clientele of training programmes\norganized by KVKs.\nFarming community: The aim is to provide an opportunity to the farmers/rural youth/farm\nwomen to acquire necessary technical know-how and technical do-how about new technologies.\nTraining encompasses on all aspects in end-to-end approach.\n122\nReport of the High Power Committee on Management of KVK\nExtension personnel: Provide an opportunity to extension personnel to expose and acquire\nknowledge, skills and competency on latest technological developments in their subject matter as\nwell as extension techniques and also build their attitude for enabling them to perform better in\nfield assignments. The field functionaries of non-government organizations working in agriculture\nand allied sector need to be treated as extension personnel for training purpose.\nVocational training: It involves long-term training to progressive farmers, farmwomen and\nrural youth in knowledge and skills, which enables them to start small-scale enterprise for self-\nemployment or generating an additional income apart from their farm income.\nTraining need assessment\nFor making training effective, the training programme must be tailored so as to meet the needs\nand requirements of the personnel engaged or likely to be engaged in the immediate future on a\nparticular job or vocation. There may be numerous techniques for determining training needs, some\nimportant are listed here:\n●Observation\n●Group discussion\n●Interviews\n●Job or activity analysis\n●Questionnaire survey\n●Personal records\n●Production records\nTraining methods/techniques\nTrainers may use different methods in a combination depending on the desired outcome of the\ntraining session. It is impossible to specify the value of any particular training method without\ngiving reference to the objective of the training. In formulating a training design, trainer should\nconsider which type of method fits the different training objectives keeping in view the main objective\nto impart necessary and adequate entrepreneurial and technology skills . Some of them are as follows:\nKnowledge: The basic requirement for acquiring or altering knowledge (concepts, ideas, facts\netc) is that information be presented clearly to the learner. Appropriate technique for communicating\ninformation includes interactive lectures, group discussion, symposia, panel discussion, success\nstories, case studies, audio and video play, field visits etc .\nSkills: Change in the actual ability to do something usually requires practice with feedback\nabout the success or failure of the practice. Hands on experience reinforced by video or audio tape\nrecording and playback, intermittent process analysis, use of group actions, coaching, interactive\ndemonstrations, etc are helpful for improving skill of trainees.\nAttitude: For attitude change, appropriate small, informal, open ended discussion groups may\nbe effective in training sessions To the degrees that these discussion groups are important or valuable\nto the participants, attitude changes are more likely to be lasting. Other training methods that are\nhelpful for bringing about attitude change include interview situation in which one participant\n123\nScientific and Technical\nlistens carefully to another’s descriptions of their attitudes and problems, and role-playing. Role-\nplaying can be especially helpful in attitude change because the learner actually experience the new\nattitudes, feels little threat, and is supported by other members of the training group.\nExperiential learning cycle\nTrainees acquire new learning more effectively by doing or acting than sitting as passive listeners.\nIt has four steps, which are as follows:\nStep 1: Experience: Experiential learning cycle starts with some kind of experience in the\nform of a lecture, method demonstration, role playing, etc. which has been planned by the trainers.\nStep 2: Processing: Doing something alone will not produce lasting changes in the trainees.\nTherefore, involving all the trainees for sharing their individual experiences and their reactions to\nthe experience will reflect on what happened, what they liked or not liked about the experience and\nwhat was easy or difficult. The trainer guides the processing of information.\nStep 3: Generalization: General conclusions are drawn from the experience. Here, trainer\nmoves the discussion away from the immediate experience relating to the experiences of everyday\nlife. Trainees seek to identify key generalization that could be derived from the experience provided.\nStep 4: Application: General learning has to find application on the farmers’ fields. Trainer\nhelps the farmers think about what they are going to do after the session is over. They answer the",

    "question": "uestions, “now what?” and “How can I use what I learned?” This stage focuses on specific actions\nback on the farm; it helps the farmers plan for the application for new skills or practices.\nEffectiveness of training\nTraining effectiveness depends not only on what happens during training, but also on what\nhappens before the actual training and what happens after the training has formally ended. Evaluation\nshould, therefore, be done of both the pre-training and post-training work.\nPre-training: This is being conducted before the commencement of the training programme to\nmodify the course content according to the felt needs and expectations of the target trainees. A part\nfrom this, the brief information about the trainees is collected to know their socio-economic profile.\nIt is to ensure that the redesigned course schedule fits to the aspirations of the participant trainees as\nwell as their prevailing socio-economic conditions.\nPre training test: The effectiveness of training programmes with respect to the perception,\nknowledge and skill level of the trainees may be done through pre- and post-evaluation. Pre-evaluation\nguides the trainers to modify their training programmes as per needs of the clientele.\nCourse evaluation: This is conducted after the training programme to obtain the feedback\nfrom the trainees about the training programme, training facilities, trainer, training equipment,\nsubject matter as well as the shortcomings, scope and suggestions for improvement.

    "question": "uickly contribute to increased total food and agricultural \nproduction. This resulted in considerable depletion of natural resources and the rainfed \ndry areas having maximum concentration of resource poor farmers remained ignored,",
    "answer": "ggravating problems of inequity and regional imbalances. This also led to a high \nconcentration of malnourished people in these rainfed, low productive areas. This era \nalso witnessed rapid loss of soil nutrients, agro-biodiversity including indigenous land \nraces and breeds.  \n \nThe agriculture policy must accelerate all-round development and economic \nviability of agriculture in comprehensive terms. Farmers must be provided the \nnecessary support, encouragement and incentives. It must focus both on income and \ngreater on-farm and off-farm job and livelihood opportunities.  \n \nMain Issues \n \n \n \n3 \nIn national priority setting, the following recurring and emerging issues for \nsustainable agricultural development and poverty alleviation must be considered: \n \n(i) Population pressure and demographic transition; \n(ii) Resource base degradation and water scarcity; \n \n(iii) Investment in agriculture, structural adjustment and impact on the poor; \n \n(iv) Globalization and implication on the poor; \n \n(v) Modern science and technology and support to research and technology \ndevelopment; and \n \n(vi) Rapid urbanization and urbanization of poverty, and deceleration in rural poverty \nreduction. \n \n \nIn addressing the above issues, a policy statement on agriculture must take note of the \nfollowing uncommon opportunities: \n \n• Conservation of natural resources and protection of environment.  \n  \n• Vast untapped potential of our soil and water resources, and farming systems \n \n• Technology revolution especially in the areas of molecular biology, \nbiotechnology, space technology, ecology and management. \n \n• Revolution in informatics and communication and the opportunity of linking \nfarmers, extension workers and scientists with the national and international \ndatabases \n \n \nVision \n \nThe Agriculture Policy document must articulate a clear vision on following few \nbasic parameters of the agricultural sector around which a policy framework must be \ndeveloped. \n \n• Organization of agriculture: A clear long-term vision where inter-sectoral \nlinkages are explicit.    \n \n• Sustainability and natural resource management: Prescription must lie in the \ndomain of political economy. Otherwise, allocating funds for watershed \ndevelopment, agroforestry, soil conservation, and so on will not produce desired \nresults.   \n  \n \n \n4 \n• Institutional change: Policy document must spell out new approaches and new \ninstitutions free from the shackles of bureaucratic and self-help framework.  \n \n• Investment priorities: There is a need to develop a consensus on investment \nthemes, priorities and policies. Policy document must lend strength to the claim \nfor greater investment in rural areas, and also re-examine its programmes in the \nlight of complementarities.  \n \n• Incentives: Document must articulate a clear vision on the incentive framework. \n \n• Risk management    \n \n \nChallenges, Policies and Strategies \n \n \nEnhancing Yield of Major Commodities  \n \nYield of major crops and livestock in the region is much lower than that in the \nrest of the world. Considering that the frontiers of expansion of cultivated area are \nalmost closed in the region, the future increase in food production to meet the \ncontinuing high demand must come from increase in yield. There is a need to \nstrengthen adaptive research and technology assessment, refinement and transfer \ncapabilities of the country so that the existing wide technology transfer gaps are \nbridged. For this, an appropriate network of extension service needs to be created to \nstimulate and encourage both top-down and bottom-up flows of information between \nfarmers, extension workers, and research scientists to promote the generation, \nadoption, and evaluation of location specific farm technologies. Ample scope exists for \nincreasing genetic yield potential of a large number of vegetables, fruits as well as \nother food crops and livestock and fisheries products. Besides maintenance breeding, \ngreater effort should be made towards developing hybrid varieties as well as varieties \nsuitable for export purposes. Agronomic and soil researches in the region need to be \nintensified to address location specific problems as factor productivity growth is \ndecelerating in major production regimes. Research on coarse grains, pulses and \noilseeds must achieve a production breakthrough. Hybrid rice, single cross hybrids of \nmaize and pigeonpea hybrids offer new opportunities.  Soybean, sunflower and oil palm \nwill help in meeting future oil demands successfully. Forest cover must be preserved to \nkeep off climatic disturbances and to provide enough of fuel and fodder. Milk, meat and \ndraught capacity of our animals needs to be improved quickly through better \nmanagement practices.     \n \nIntegrated nutrient management: Attention should be given to balanced use of \nnutrients.  Phosphorus deficiency is now the most widespread soil fertility problem in \nboth irrigated and unirrigated areas. Correcting the distortion in relative prices of \nprimary fertilizers could help correct the imbalances in the use of primary plant nutrients \n \n \n5 \n-nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash and use of bio-fertilizers. To improve efficiency of \nfertilizer use, what is really needed is enhanced location-specific research on efficient \nfertilizer practices (such as balanced use of nutrients, correct timing and placement of \nfertilizers, and, wherever necessary, use of micronutrient and soil amendments), \nimprovement in soil testing services, development of improved fertilizer supply and \ndistribution systems, and development of physical and institutional infrastructure.  \n \nArresting deceleration in total factor productivity: Public investment in irrigation, \ninfrastructure development (road, electricity), research and extension and efficient use \nof water and plant nutrients are the dominant sources of TFP growth. The sharp \ndeceleration in total investment and more so in public sector investment in agriculture is \nthe main cause for the deceleration. This has resulted in the slow-down in the growth of \nirrigated area and a sharp deceleration in the rate of growth of fertiliser consumption. \nThe most serious effect of deceleration in total investment has been on agricultural \nresearch and extension. This trend must be reversed as the projected increase in food \nand non-food production must accrue essentially through increasing yield per hectare. \nRecognising that there are serious yield gaps and there are already proven paths for \nincreasing productivity, it is very important for India to maintain a steady growth rate in \ntotal factor productivity. As the TFP increases, the cost of production decreases and the \nprices also decrease and stabilise. Both producer and consumer share the benefits.  \nThe fall in food prices will benefit the urban and rural poor more than the upper income \ngroups, because the former spend a much larger proportion of their income on cereals \nthan the latter. All the efforts need to be concentrated on accelerating growth in TFP, \nwhilst conserving natural resources and promoting ecological integrity of agricultural \nsystem. More than half of the required growth in yield to meet the target of demand \nmust be met from research efforts by developing location specific and low input use \ntechnologies with the emphasis on the regions where the current yields are below the \nrequired national average yield.   \n \nLiteracy had a positive and significant relation with crop productivity and a strong \nlink exists between literacy and farm modernisation. A recent study (Kumar and Mittal, \n2000), has shown that literacy emerged as an important source of growth in adoption of \ntechnology, use of modern inputs like machines, fertilisers, and yield. Recognising that \nin the liberalised economic environment, efficiency and growth orientation will attract \nmaximum attention. Literacy will play a far more important role in the globalised world \nthan it did in the past. Contribution of literacy, through TFP, will be substantial on yield \ngrowth and domestic supply. As future agriculture will increasingly be science-led and \nwill require modern economic management, high return to investment on education is \nexpected.   \n \nThe investments that are good for agricultural growth-technology and its \ndissemination, rural infrastructure (roads), education and irrigation - amount to a 'win-\nwin' strategy for reducing rural poverty by also increasing the non-farm economy and \nraising rural wages. Creating infrastructure in less developed areas, better \nmanagement of infrastructure and introduction of new technologies can further enhance \nresource productivity and TFP.  Generation and effective assessment and diffusion of \n \n \n6 \npackages of appropriate technologies involving system and programme based \napproach, participatory mechanisms, greater congruency between productivity and \nsustainability through integrated pest management and integrated soil-water-irrigation-\nnutrient management, should be aggressively promoted to bridge the yield gaps in most \nfield crops. Besides this, efforts must be in place to defend the gains and to make new \ngains particularly through the congruence of gene revolution, informatics revolution, \nmanagement revolution and eco-technology. \n   \nMany observers have expressed concern that technological gains have not \noccurred in a number of crops, notably coarse cereals, pulses and in rainfed areas. \nRecent analysis on TFP growth based on cost of cultivation data does not prove this \nperception (Table 2). In all the 18 major crops considered in the analysis, several states \nhave recorded positive TFP growth. This is spread over major cereals, coarse grains, \npulses, oilseeds, fibres, vegetables, etc. In most cases, in the major producing states, \nrainfed crops also, showed productivity gains. There is thus strong evidence that \ntechnological change has generally pervaded the entire crop sector. There are, of \ncourse, crops and states where technological stagnation or decline is apparent and \nthese are the priorities for present and future agricultural research. Farming system \nresearch to develop location specific technologies and strategy to make grey areas \ngreen by adopting three-pronged approach - watershed management, hybrid \ntechnology and small farm mechanisation will accelerate growth in TFP.  It is necessary \nto enlarge the efforts for promoting available dry land technologies. Promoting efficient \nfertiliser practices, improving soil-testing services, strengthening distribution channel of \ncritical inputs specially quality seed and development of physical and institutional \ninfrastructure will help resource-poor farmers.  \n \nBridging Yield Gaps: Vast untapped potential in the yield exists for all crops in most of \nthe states accounting for more than three-fourths of crop area.  Emphasis must be \ngiven to the states in which current yield levels are below the national average yield.  \nBihar, Orissa, Assam, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh are the priority states accounting \nfor 66% of rice area which need emphasis on bridging yield gaps to attain target \ndemand and yield growth. For wheat we must focus mainly on Uttar Pradsh, Madhya \nPradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan accounting for 68% of wheat area. For coarse cereals, \nmajor emphasis must be given to Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya \nPradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. To meet the demand for pulses greater \nemphasis is needed in almost all the states with particular focus on Madhya Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar pradesh which \nhave three-fourths of total pulse area. The target growth in pulse yield from these states \nannually must be 6 per cent; otherwise the nation will experience shortage of pulses for \nall times to come. The task of attaining self sufficient in pulses production looks difficult \nwithout area expansion and irrigation. In cases of oilseeds greater emphasis is needed \non Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West \nBengal and Uttar Pradesh to increase the yield by about 4 per cent. The possibilities of \ndeveloping processing industry for extracting edible oils from non-oilseeds \ncommodities, like rice bran etc, needing to be explored. The introduction of palm \ncultivation for oil production may release pressure on traditional oilseeds crops to meet \n \n \n7 \nfuture edible oil demand. In case of sugarcane, research and development efforts are \nto be strengthened in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to increase the yields per hectare by \nabout 4% per annum. The demand for sugar can also be met by developing mini sugar \nmills so that substantial sugarcane production can be diverted from Khandsari to sugar \nproduction. This may also help release some sugarcane area to other crops. Cotton \ncrop requires greater yield improvement emphasis on 81 per cent of the cotton area in \nMaharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.   \n \nWater for Sustainable Food Security \n \nIndia will be required to produce more and more from less and less land and \nwater resources. Alarming rates of ground water depletion and serious environmental \nand social problems of some of the major irrigation projects on one hand, and the \nmultiple benefits of irrigation water in enhancing production and productivity, food \nsecurity, poverty alleviation, as mentioned earlier, are well known to be further \nelaborated here: In India, water availability per capita was over 5000 cubic metres (m3) \nper annum in 1950. It now stands at around 2000 m3 and is projected to decline to 1500 \nm3 by 2025. Further, the quality of available water is deteriorating. Also, there are gross \ninequalities between basins and geographic regions. \n \nAgriculture is the biggest user of water, accounting for about 80 percent of the \nwater withdrawals. There are pressures for diverting water from agriculture to other \nsectors. A study. has warned that re-allocation of water out of agriculture can have a \ndramatic impact on global food markets. It is projected that availability of water for \nagricultural use in India may be reduced by 21 percent by 2020, resulting: in drop of \nyields of irrigated crops, especially rice, thus price rise and withdrawal of food from \npoor masses. Policy reforms are needed from now to avoid the negative developments \nin the years to come. These reforms may include the establishment of secure water \nrights to users, the decentralization and privatization of water. management functions to \nappropriate levels, pricing reforms, markets in tradable property rights, and the \nintroduction of appropriate water-saving technologies. \n \nThe needs of other sectors for water cannot be ignored. Therefore it is \nnecessary that an integrated water use policy is formulated and judiciously \nimplemented. Several international initiatives on this aspect have been taken in recent \nyears. India should critically examine these initiatives and develop its country-specific \nsystem for judicious and integrated use and management of water. A national institution \nshould be established to assess the various issues, regulatory concerns, water laws \nand legislations, research and technology development and dissemination, social \nmobilization and participatory and community involvement, including gender and equity \nconcerns and economic aspects. This institution should function in a trusteeship mode \nand seen as the flagship of a national system for sustainable water security. \n \n \nEmphasis on Rainfed Ecosystem  \n \n \n \n8 \nResource-poor farmers in the rainfed ecosystems practice less-intensive \nagriculture, and since their incomes depend on local agriculture, they benefit little from \nincreased food production in irrigated areas. To help them, efforts must be increased to \ndisseminate available dry land technologies and to generate new ones. It will be \nnecessary to enlarge the efforts for promoting available dry land technologies, \nincreasing the stock of this knowledge, and removing pro-irrigation biases in public \ninvestment and expenditure, as well as credit flows, for technology-based agricultural \ngrowth. Watershed development for raising yields of rainfed crops and widening of \nseed revolution to cover oilseeds, pulses, fruits and vegetables. Farming system \nresearch to develop location specific technologies must be intensified in the rainfed \nareas. Strategy to make grey areas green will lead to second Green Revolution, which \nwould demand three-pronged strategy - watershed management, hybrid technology and \nsmall farm mechanisation.   \n \nAccent on Diversification of Agriculture and Value Addition \n \nIn the face of shrinking natural resources and ever increasing demand for larger \nfood and agricultural production arising due to high population and income growths, \nagricultural intensification is the main course of future growth of agriculture in the \nregion. Research for product diversification should be yet another important area. \nBesides developing technologies for promoting intensification, the country must give \ngreater attention to the development of technologies that will facilitate agricultural \ndiversification particularly towards intensive production of fruits, vegetables, flowers \nand other high value crops that are expected to increase income growth and generate \neffective demand for food. The per capita availability of arable land is quite low and \ndeclining over time. Diversification towards these high value and labour intensive \ncommodities can provide adequate income and employment to the farmers dependent \non small size of farms. Due importance should be given to quality and nutritional \naspects. High attention should be given to develop post-harvest handling and agro-\nprocessing and value addition technologies not only to reduce the heavy post-harvest \nlosses and also improve quality through proper storage, packaging, handling and \ntransport. The role of biotechnology in post-harvest management and value addition \ndeserves to be enhanced.       \n \nAccent on Post-Harvest Management, Value Addition and Cost-Effectiveness \n \n \nPost-harvest losses generally range from 5 to 10 percent for non-perishables \nand about 30 percent for perishables. This loss could be and must be minimized. Let us \nremember, a grain saved is a grain produced. Emphasis should therefore be placed to \ndevelop post-harvest handling, agro-processing and value-addition technologies not \nonly to prevent the high losses, but also to improve quality through proper storage, \npackaging, handling and transport. With the thrust on globalization and increasing \ncompetitiveness, this approach will improve the agricultural export contribution of India, \nwhich is proportionately extremely low. Cost-effectiveness in production and post-\nharvest handling through the application of latest technologies will be a necessity. The \nagro-processing facilities should preferably be located close to the points of production \n \n \n9 \nin rural areas, which will greatly promote off-farm employment. Such centres of \nprocessing and value addition will encourage production by masses against mass \nproduction in factories located in urban areas. Agricultural cooperatives and Gram \nPanchayats must play a leading role in this effort. In doing so, the needs of small \nfarmers should be kept in mind. \n \nIncreased Investment in Agriculture and Infrastructures  \n \nThe public investment in agriculture has been declining and is one of the main \nreasons behind the declining productivity and low capital formation in the agriculture \nsector. With the burden on productivity - driven growth in the future, this worrisome \ntrend must be reversed. Private investment in agriculture has also been slow and must \nbe stimulated through appropriate policies. Considering that nearly 70 percent of India \nstill lives in villages, agricultural growth will continue to be the engine of broad-based \neconomic growth and development as well as of natural resource conservation, leave \nalone food security and poverty alleviation. Accelerated investment are needed to \nfacilitate agricultural and rural development through: \n \n• Productivity increasing varieties of crops, breeds of livestock, strains of \nmicrobes and efficient packages of technologies, particularly those for \nland and water management, for obviating biotic, a biotic, socio-economic \nand environmental constraints;  \n \n• Yield \nincreasing \nand \nenvironmentally-friendly \nproduction \nand \npost-harvest and value-addition technologies;  \n  \n• Reliable and timely availability of quality inputs at reasonable prices, \ninstitutional and credit supports, especially for small and resource-poor \nfarmers, and support to land and water resources development;  \n \n• Effective and credible technology, procurement, assessment and transfer \nand extension system involving appropriate linkages and partnerships; \nagain with an emphasis on reaching the small farmers; \n \n• Improved institutional and credit support and increased rural employment \nopportunities, including those through creating agriculture-based rural \nagro-processing and agro-industries, improved rural infrastructures, \nincluding access to information, and effective markets, farm to market \nroads and related infrastructure; \n \n• Particular attention to the needs and participation of women farmers; and \n \n• Primary education, health care, clean drinking water, safe sanitation, \nadequate nutrition, particularly for children (including through mid-day \nmeal at schools) and women. \n \nThe above investments will need to be supported through appropriate policies \n \n \n10 \nthat do not discriminate against agriculture and the rural poor. Given the increasing role \nof small farmers in food security and poverty alleviation, development efforts must be \ngeared to meet the needs and potential of such farmers through their active \nparticipation in the growth process.   \n   \nGovernment should facilitate and support community level action by private \nvoluntary organizations, including farmers groups aimed at improving food security, \nreducing poverty, and assuring sustainability in the management of natural resources.  \nIn addition, governments should enhance efforts to ensure good nutrition and access to \nsufficient food for all through primary health care and education for all. \n \nModern biotechnology tools, genetic engineering, as well as conventional \nbreeding methods are all expected to play important roles in the generation of higher \nyielding, pest and stress resistant varieties of rice, wheat, maize and other cereal \ncrops. The availability of genetic innovations in developing countries will depend on \ncontinued high levels of investments in agricultural research, both at the international \nand the national levels.  Free and unhindered access to germplasm to breeders \nworldwide is absolutely crucial to the rapid dissemination and adoption of improved \ngermplasm.  This free movement and the dissemination of modern biotechnology \ninnovations to developing countries are hampered by increased patent protection and \nprivate sector investments.  There is an urgent need to address this problem of free \naccess to technology in the future. \n \nIncreased attention will also have to be given to development of sustainable \nsystems that protect the natural resource base.  Recent evidence of resource \ndegradation and declining productivity in some intensively cropped areas is of \nparticular concern.  Also population driven intensification of agriculture without the use \nof external inputs, is leading to a serious problem of mining soil fertility \n \nSustaining global food supplies will depend on continued high levels of \ninvestments in research and technology development.  It is essential that research \ncapacity has to be increased substantially. In addition to investments in research, \ninfrastructure investments, particularly in irrigation, transport and market infrastructure \ndevelopment are equally important for sustaining the productivity and profitability of \nfood crop production.   \n \nMobilize the best of science and development efforts (including traditional \nknowledge and modern scientific approach) through partnerships involving national and \ninternational research institutions, NGOs, farmers' organizations and private sector in \norder to tackle the present and future problems of food security and production. \n \nDonors and Government must urgently increase funding for agricultural research \ntargeted at the needs of the rural and urban poor, and every effort must be made to \nensure the free flow of information, technology and germplasm so that a proper \nsustainable agriculture can be achieved.   \n \n \n \n \n11 \nFighting Poverty and Hunger \n \nNearly one-fourth of India's population, 251 million out of nearly one billion, is \nbelow the poverty line. One hundred seventy millions of the poor, 68 percent, are rural \nand the remaining 32 percent are urban (Table 4). Number at the national level in rural \narea has decreased after 1983; the number of poor in the cities has been increasing. \nThis is essentially due to migration of the destitute from villages to cities. There are \nserious implications of this trend on feeding the cities and food security of urban \npeople, urban poverty and environment. A question may be asked as to whether the \nrural settings and opportunities could be improved for securing livelihood security and \nconsequently rationalizing the migration to the cities.  \n \nAn analysis of the incidence of rural poverty and hunger by farm size revealed \nthat more than half of the landless people are poor. Poverty got significantly reduced \nfrom 54 percent in the landless group to 38 percent in the sub-marginal group (Table \n5), suggesting that even a small piece of land, less than 1/2 hectare, can greatly reduce \nboth poverty and hunger1. The incidence of hunger and poverty gets reduced as one is \nable to meet even part of his/her dietary energy requirement through growing his/her \nown food (Table 6). Studies show that even a small plot of one's own helps women to \nescape extreme poverty and deprivation.  Land is the main asset for livelihood security. \n \nAlthough several factors affect the extent and depth of poverty and hunger, some \nof them have overwhelming impacts under the Indian setting. These include, irrigation, \nfarming system and literacy. Generally, there is higher concentration of poor, and \nhungry people in rainfed areas as compared with those in irrigated zones. Even with 20 \npercent of the irrigation intensity, there is a sharp fall in the proportion of hunger and \npoverty and it remains there irrespective of further intensification of irrigation (Table 7). \nEvidences suggest that extensive irrigation will prove much more effective than to \nadding more and more water, and often wasting it along with the associated \ndegradation of the natural resources. Such a policy will not only reduce poverty and \nhunger, but will also promote equity and environmental protection and natural resource \nconservation.  An effective water policy and institutional support is needed to ensure \njudicious and equitable allocation, distribution and exploitation of water and water \nresources.  \n \nLivestock has the highest effect on reducing poverty and hunger.  In rural India, \n43 percent of the people who do not own even a single livestock are malnourished. \nAddition of one cattle or one buffalo to their assets reduces the hunger prevalence by \n16 and 25 percentage points, respectively (Table 8). Only 14 percent of the people who \nowned one cattle and one buffalo were malnourished. In urban areas also, the addition \nof one cattle or one buffalo had significant impact on reduction of proportion of \n                         \n1 Energy intake below minimum energy requirement (kcal/person/day). Three-fourth of \nrecommended calories (2400/person/day) for rural India that is 1800 kcal/person/day is used the \nthreshold level. An average individual has an intake below this level (the threshold) is \nundernourished because they do not eat enough to maintain health, body weight and to under \ntake light activity.  \n \n \n \n12 \nmalnourished people. Livestock sector should also receive high priority with multiple \nobjectives of diversifying agriculture, raising income and meeting the nutritional security \nof the poor farm households.  \n \nLiteracy has a very high impact on poverty alleviation as well as on hunger \nreduction (Table 9). The illiterate people, whether urban or rural, are the most poor and \nmalnourished. In urban areas the impact of literacy on poverty is the highest. \nEducation, even above primary level, is extremely effective in reducing both poverty \nand hunger. Graduate and technical education is, of course, the most important \ninstrument for reducing both poverty and hunger. But its impact is most visible on \npoverty reduction. Therefore, the education policy of the country must be geared to \nremove illiteracy as soon as possible, as 50 percent of our people are still illiterate. \nFree education up to 8’th standard coupled with mid-day meal in the schools will go a \nlong way in reducing both poverty and hunger and will thus help build a strong India. \nFurther, this move will greatly reduce the violation of child labour laws and will offset \nsome of the non-tariff restrictions imposed by developed countries on exports from \ndeveloping countries on the grounds of use of child labour. \n \n \nAccent on Empowering the Small Farmers \n \nContributions of small holders in securing food for growing population have \nincreased considerably even though they are most insecure and vulnerable group in \nthe society. The off-farm and non-farm employment opportunities can play an important \nrole. Against expectation under the liberalized scenario, the non-agricultural \nemployment in rural areas has not improved. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on \nnon-farm employment and appropriate budgetary allocations and rural credit through \nbanking systems should be in place to promote appropriate rural enterprises. Specific \nhuman resource and skill development programmes to train them will make them better \ndecision-makers and highly productive. Human resource development for increasing \nproductivity of these small holders should get high priority.  Thus, knowledge and skill \ndevelopment of rural people both in agriculture and non-agriculture sectors is essential \nfor achieving economic and social goals. A careful balance will therefore need to be \nmaintained between the agricultural and non-agricultural employment and farm and \nnon-farm economy, as the two sectors are closely inter-connected.  \n \nRaising agricultural productivity requires continuing investments in human \nresource development, agricultural research and development, improved information \nand extension, market, roads and related infrastructure development and efficient \nsmall-scale, farmer-controlled irrigation technologies, and custom hiring services. Such \ninvestments would give small farmers the options and flexibility to adjust and respond to \nmarket conditions.  \n \nFor poor farm-households whose major endowment is its labour force, economic \ngrowth with equity will give increased entitlement by offering favourable markets for its \nproducts and more employment opportunities.  Economic growth if not managed \nsuitably, can lead to growing inequalities. Agrarian reforms to alleviate unequal access \n \n \n13 \nto land, compounded by unequal access to water, credit, knowledge and markets, have \nnot only rectified income distribution but also resulted in sharp increases in productivity \nand hence need to be adopted widely. Further, targeted measures that not only \naddress the immediate food and health care requirements of disadvantaged groups, but \nalso provide them with developmental means, like access to inputs, infrastructure, \nservices and most important, education should be taken.   \n \nIdentification of need-based productive programs is very critical, which can be \nexplored through characterisation of production environment.  We have to develop \ndemand-driven and location-specific programs to meet the requirements of different \nregions to meet the nutritional security of most vulnerable population in the rural areas. \nImproved agricultural technology, irrigation, livestock sector and literacy will be most \nimportant instruments for improving the nutritional security of the farm-households. \nWatershed development and water saving techniques will have far reaching \nimplications in increasing agricultural production and raising calorie intake in the \nrainfed areas. Livestock sector should receive high priority with multiple objectives of \ndiversifying agriculture, raising income and meeting the nutritional security of the poor \nfarm households. Need based and location-specific community programs, which \npromise to raise nutritional security, should be identified and effectively implemented. \nExpansion of micro credit programmes for income-generation activities, innovative \napproaches to promote family planning and providing primary health services to people \nand livestock and education should enhance labour productivity and adoption of new \ntechnologies.  Development of the post-harvest sector, co-operatives, roads, education, \nand research and development should be an investment priority. A congenial policy \nenvironment is needed to enable smaller holders to take the advantage of available \ntechniques of production, which can generate more incomes and employment in \nvillages. For this poor farmer needs the support of necessary services in the form of \nbackward and forward linkages. Small-mechanised tools, which minimise drudgery and \ndo not reduce employment, but only add value to the working hours are needed to \nenhance labour productivity. Special safety nets should be designed and implemented \nfor them.  Can agricultural co-operatives internalise and galvanize these marginal and \nexcluded people? Off-farm employment provided through co-operatives will go a long \nway in pulling them out of the state where poverty breeds poverty.  Therefore, \ninvestment in the empowerment of the small landholders will pay off handsomely. Let \nus create rural centres of production and processing by masses through co-operatives \nor empowerment of Gram Panchayats to promote co-operatives. This will improve \nefficiency of input and output marketing and give higher income. There is need to \ndisseminate widely post-harvest handling and agro-processing and value addition \ntechnologies not only to reduce the heavy post-harvest losses but also improve quality \nthrough proper storage, packaging, handling and transport.  Panchayati Raj institutions \nand co-operatives can play significant role in all these directions. Giving them power \nover the administration, as contemplated under the 73rd and 74th Amendment of the \nConstitution has not been implemented seriously so far in any of the states.  \n \nDisaster Management \n \n \nThe frequency and intensity of disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones and \n \n \n14 \nearthquakes have increased in the recent years. The devastating earthquake in Gujarat \nhas brought untold miseries to the whole state and caused a national disaster. Special \neffort should be made to develop appropriate technologies for increasing preparedness \nto predict and to manage the disasters. Effective and reliable information and \ncommunication systems, contingency planning and national and international \nmobilization of technologies and resources are a must. Experiences of other countries \nin prevention and management of the disasters should be shared. \n \nKeeping Pace with Globalisation \n \nThe globalization of agricultural trade will bring to the fore access to markets; \nnew opportunities for employment and income generation; productivity gains and \nincreased flow of investments into sustainable agriculture and rural development. I \nbelieve that if managed well, the liberalization of agricultural markets will be beneficial \nto developing countries in the long run, It will force the adoption of new technologies, \nshift production functions upwards and attract new capital into the deprived sector. \nHowever, this will only come to pass if we are mindful of the interests of billions of small \nand subsistence oriented farmers, fisher-folk and forest dwellers in the short and \nmedium tern. So far the magic of globalization has not been felt in India.  During the \npast one-decade of liberalization certain trends such as deceleration of the growth rate \nof agricultural GDP, declaration in yield growth rates, and low non-agricultural \nemployment have emerged against expectations. As we globalize, however, it is \nimperative that we do not forget social aspirations for a more just, equitable and \nsustainable way of life. Trade agreements must be accompanied by operationally \neffective measures to ease the adjustment process for a small farmer in developing \ncountries. \n \nExploiting Cyberspace \n \nInformation is power and will underpin future progress and prosperity. Efforts \nmust be made to strengthen the informatics in agriculture by developing new \ndatabases, linking databases with international databases and adding value to \ninformation to facilitate decision making at various levels. Development of production \nmodels for various agro-ecological regimes to forecast the, production potential should \nassume greater importance. Using the remote sensing and GIS technologies, natural \nand other agricultural resource should be mapped at micro and macro levels and \neffectively used for land and water use planning as well as agricultural forecasting, \nmarket intelligence and e-business, contingency planning and prediction of disease \nand pest incidences.  \n \n \n15 \nTable 1: Demand for Agricultural Commodities \n \nAchieved TE 1997-99 \nDemand in 2020 \n(million tons) \nYield target in \n2020 \nItem \nArea \n(Million \nha) \nProduction \n(Million \ntons) \nYield \n(Kg/ha) \nLIG \nHIG \nLIG \nHIG \nRice \n42.2 \n85.7 \n1903 \n112.4 \n111.9 \n2664 \n2652 \nWheat \n26.2 \n69.1 \n2582 \n82.3 \n79.9 \n3137 \n3045 \nCoarse cereal \n30.7 \n30.4 \n1041 \n38.9 \n37.3 \n1268 \n1214 \nCereal \n99.1 \n185.2 \n1814 \n233.6 \n229.0 \n2357 \n2311 \nPulses \n21.7 \n13.8 \n608 \n22.3 \n23.8 \n1029 \n1095 \nFoodgrains \n120.8 \n199.0 \n1595 \n255.9 \n252.8 \n2119 \n2092 \nEdible oil \n28.6 \n6.4 \n269 \n10.8 \n11.4 \n379.7 \n399 \nPotato \n1.2 \n21.6 \n17188 \n27.8 \n30.6 \n22279 \n24566 \nVegetables \n5.3 \n74.5 \n14204 \n135.6 \n168.0 \n25673 \n31812 \nFruits \n3.2 \n43.0 \n13437 \n77.0 \n93.6 \n24064 \n29259 \nSugarcane \nGur \n3.7 \n26.9 \n7006 \n32.6 \n33.7 \n8788 \n9088 \nMilk \n- \n71.2 \n- \n115.8 \n137.3 \n- \n- \nMeat \n- \n5.0 \n- \n8.8 \n11.4 \n- \n- \nEggs number \n- \n2873  \n- \n7750 \n10000 \n- \n- \nFish \n- \n5.3 \n- \n10.1 \n12.8 \n- \n- \nSource: R.S.Paroda and Praduman Kumar (2000).

Discussion with my colleagues on this issue \nlead to this new series “Research & Policy”. We wish that \nthis series will provide the breadth and depth of research into an area topped up by a \nlucid presentation for the policy makers. \nI am happy to present the sixth publication in this series on “Agricultural Challenges \nand Policies for the 21st Century” written by Dr. Ramesh Chand.\nI wish this new series acts as a bridge between the researchers and policy makers.\nP. V. S. Suryakumar\nDeputy Managing Director\n \niv\nv\nPreface\nAgriculture sector proved a silver lining in the pandemic \n­period registering a positive growth in the covid times. Yet it \nfaces various structural challenges to be addressed to make it \nprofitable. For, the majority of the population is still dependent \non the sector. As we all know, investing in research is one of \nthe best strategies to address problems of agriculture. Equally \nimportant is to communicate the research findings to policy \nmakers to design and tweak policies that matter. During one \nof our meetings with Shri P. V. S. Suryakumar, our DMD, we \nhad loud thinking if we can commission a few review papers \non select themes. We thought that it is appropriate to request veteran scholars who \nspent prime of their life on a given research theme to attempt such a work where they \nwill distil their understanding and the research done on the theme in a short paper. \nDuly encouraged by DMD and Chairman, we wrote to a dozen eminent scholars. And \nthe ­response was overwhelming resulting in Department of Economic Analysis and \n­Research (DEAR), the research wing of NABARD, initiating the ‘Research and Policy \nSeries’. The motivation is, thus, to get a few handles from research that can help ­effective \npolicy intervention. This series will be useful to policy makers and researchers alike. \nThe ‘Research and Policy’ series is an attempt to get a glimpse of hardcore research \n­findings in a capsule form thereby making it more effective and communicative to \n­policy makers. The group of researchers who agreed to prepare a review of research \nhave spent their life in the field of agricultural research. Our purpose here, as we \n­communicated to them, was not just to get literature survey but to get researcher’s heart \nand their ­experience which they gained during their long passionate innings. The paper \nis expected to highlight various issues, policy relevance, prescription, and suggestion \nfor future papers on the themes of interest to NABARD.\nAgriculture policies implemented by governments at various levels after the \n­Independence were critical in bringing socio-economic transformation to many parts of \nthe country. These production methods, despite their achievements, must be ­evaluated \nagainst the test of sustainability and the challenges they present for the sector’s ­current \ngrowth. In view of this, the current paper on “Agricultural Challenges and Policies \n \nvi\nfor the 21st Century” written by Dr. Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog, assumes \n­importance. Dr. Ramesh Chand has a distinguished academic career, with research \ninterests in agriculture that include production, growth, development policy, farmers’ \nissues, markets, and trade.\nThe paper begins by examining the severity and extent of various types of challenges \nconfronting Indian agriculture, ranging from over exploitation of natural resources to \nsmallholder viability to agricultural research and development. It then highlights key \npolicies and initiatives that can be put in place to address these issues. While ­discussing \nthe policies, the author thoroughly reviewed the current agri-marketing and MSP \n­policies and tried to provide solutions to major problems under the current policy setup. \nAt the end, the author discusses various issues that must be debated to ensure sustain-\nability of all the stakeholders in agricultural sector. Overall, the paper will give readers \nmore to think about.\nIn bringing this series as planned, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. \nG. R. Chintala, Chairman, NABARD for his inspiring leadership, unstinted support and \nguidance. We also wish to express our sincere thanks to Shri P. V. S. Suryakumar, DMD, \nfor being the inspiration and the driving force behind the publication of this first of its \nkind series. We are grateful to the authors of this series who agreed to write on themes \nrelevant to NABARD in such a short period of time. Indeed, it has been a great privilege \nfor us. \nI also acknowledge the contributions of the officers of DEAR, NABARD especially Dr. \nAshutosh Kumar, DGM; Mrs. Geeta Acharya, Manager; Ms Neha Gupta, Shri Vinay \nJadhav, Assistant Managers, and others who coordinated with the authors and the \n­editor to bring out the series as envisaged.\nThanks are due to Dr. J.

From an uncomfortable state of acute shortage \nof food, widespread hunger and heavy import dependence, the ­country has emerged \nas a net exporter and surplus producer of many ­agricultural ­commodities. The over-\nall ­effect of the Green Revolution technology and other aspects of the ­agricultural \n­strategy and policy is that the per capita production of food in the country has \nmore than doubled during the last 50 years, despite the 237% increase in human \n­population. \nTill a few years back, the entire agriculture strategy was focused on the ­single \nmotto of ‘grow more food’ at any cost. This strategy brought many ­positive changes \nlike food self-sufficiency, emergence of export surplus of many ­commodities, ­better \nnourishment, socio-economic transformation in some ­regions, increase in rural ­wages \nand employment, and gradual increase in farm income. But these achievements also \nthrew up new challenges on ­several fronts, and some of those are formidable and \n­require urgent attention. \nThe foremost challenge relates to sustainability of the current ­method of \n­production. The indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and ­weedicides, \nexpansion of irrigation, and crop specialisations ­favouring a few crops, which were \nthe main sources of growth of agriculture post-Green ­Revolution, played havoc with \nnatural resources, environment and ­ecology. Heavy subsidy and free supply of power \nfor irrigation led to reckless, ­indiscriminate and overuse of ­water, and brought serious \ndistortions in crop choices.\nAgriculture is quite important in determining quality of air, water and land, and \npressure on land and water, which are pillars of sustainability. In order to check \n­further overexploitation of water resources, the country should create a ­policy \n­environment that leads to crop pattern and practices consistent with the natural \nresource ­endowment in various agro ecological zones. Further, without improving \nefficiency of water use in agriculture through modern methods of irrigation (drip, \nsprinkler and sensors), stress on water use and future water requirement cannot be \naddressed. \nxvi\nDespite the technological breakthroughs in many areas, our productivity levels \nboth in crops and livestock at the national level remained lower than many other major \nagricultural countries. Agricultural practices involving ­prolific use of inputs like broad-\ncasting of fertilizer and flood irrigation are not showing any significant ­improvement. \nIn most of the crops, increase in ­productivity has been accompanied by an increase in \naverage cost of production that ­necessitated an increase in output prices to keep incre-\nmental production profitable. The ­dependence of the agriculture sector on government \n­support is rising. Because of this, the sector is becoming less competitive.  \nIndia is accumulating a large surplus of rice, wheat and sugar which ­involves a \nhuge cost to state exchequer. On the other hand, deficit in edible oils is rising year ­after \nyear. Disposing off surplus rice and sugar in international markets needs high level \nof financial support, because international prices are lower than the cost of ­supply or \ndomestic price of the produce. \nThe country spends more than Rs. 30,000 crore each year after 2007-08 as ­capital \nexpenditure and also huge amounts on operation and ­maintenance of canals, but area \nunder canal irrigation has shown either stagnation or a ­decline. This disquieting trend \nnecessitates a close examination and urgent ­action to ­ensure that country’s resources \nspent on canal irrigation gives ­expected ­returns.\nIndian diets are changing in a significant manner. Per capita absorption of ­cereals \nhas witnessed the smallest increase, despite an increase in availability and heavy \nsubsidy of cereals. There is a manifold increase in the per capita net availability of \nvegetables, fruits and milk for domestic consumption. ­However, around 16% of the \npopulation still live in hunger, and a large population ­remains malnourished. India \npresents a paradoxical situation of ‘hunger in the midst of plenty’. Health of children \nand women is also a matter of concern.\nLow intake of the total food is the main reason for widespread hunger and \n­malnutrition. The country would need to relook at policy interventions in ­agriculture \nthat are heavily biased towards rice, wheat and sugar, which are ­produced in excess \nof domestic and export demand. Further, nutrition ­awareness is very important to \nimprove nutrition and health, as there is a ­growing tendency for preferring more of \nspicy, oily and sugary foods to ­nutritive food. Attributing poor nutrition entirely to low \npaying capacity is not correct.\nxvii\nIf the current trends in agriculture are not corrected, there will be little \n­improvement in reducing the gap between agriculture and non-­agriculture ­income \nand alleviating rural distress. In this background, the present ­government has set a \nvision for a new India that involves ‘Sabka Saath ­Sabka Vikas’. Agriculture growth is \nsignificantly beneficial for reducing poverty and increasing per capita income of low-\nincome classes in rural India. Beside ­inclusive growth, agriculture matters for health \nand nutrition, sustainability, climate change and the quality of life in the country. All \nthese factors underscore the need for a new vision for agriculture as we move forward \nin the 21st century – a vision that addresses various challenges facing agriculture.\nIronically, high growth rate in agriculture experienced during some phas-\nes did not bring down real prices of food in the country. The reason has been that \nthe prices drove output growth rather than output growth ­determining prices! The \ngoal and ­strategy for agriculture must shift from ‘growth to ­efficient growth’. ­Indian \n­agriculture is ­without the state-of-the-art technology and modern methods of \n­farming. ­Application of advanced science at the farm ­level requires skill, knowledge, \ninvestment and ­improvement in human capital in farming. Upgrading farming from \nlow-tech to ­high-tech (like greenhouse ­cultivation, poly houses, tissue culture and \nprecision farming) will reduce the average cost, raise farmers income and address \nsome scale disabilities. \nLately, methods that have roots in traditional Indian methods of ­farming like \n­natural farming and organic farming are being proposed in place of ­chemical-based \nfarming with the aim to reduce cost of production, besides also addressing adverse \n­effects of chemicals on health, environment and ­natural resources. Lot of ­anecdotal \nevidence is quoted in support of benefits of the ­alternative system of farming. \n­However, the scientific community in public ­research institutes cast doubts on the \nclaim of ­benefits of traditional systems of farming and raise the issue of a significant \nyield discount in such methods, which could be detrimental to the food and nutrition \nsecurity of the country in coming years. They feel, the breakthrough in ­biotechnology \nand ­scientific ­practices like integrated pest management (IPM) and integrated plant \n­nutrient (IPN) systems, modern methods of fertiliser application and irrigation can \n­address various concerns related to farming, based on the use of agro-­chemicals \n­rather than taking the risk of a shift towards natural farming. Public research system \nmust look into various aspects of alternative methods of farming and develop best \nxviii\npractices to meet public preferences and the national goals of ­raising ­farmers income \nby lowering costs and supply of safe and healthy food.  \nCapital intensive production preferred by the manufacturing sector and ­anticipated \nthreats to jobs posed by emerging technological innovations ­necessitate a rethinking \nof the development strategy of shifting workforce from agriculture to ­manufacturing \nand services. India should explore possibilities of creating blue collar jobs in and \naround agriculture. \nCurrent and projected growth for food demand and supply reveal that ­India would \nneed to add 20% - 25% of incremental output to the current level of food exports. \nThis requires export competitiveness. At present, the minimum ­support prices (MSP) \nof some commodities recommended by the government are higher than the interna-\ntional prices. If such MSP is used for procurement, it will keep domestic prices higher \nthan international prices, thus, making the exports impossible. \nKeeping prices artificially above the levels dictated by demand and ­supply and \nforcing them on the market through government interventions causes ­serious price \ndistortions, which have a number of implications. The best ­option in such situations is \nto pay the farmers the difference between a reasonable MSP and average market price \nat the state level, as is the practice in many countries.\nRegulatory restrictions on marketing and absence of business-friendly envi-\nronment in agriculture acts as a deterrent for corporate investment in ­agriculture \n­production and marketing. This is said to be an important reason for the slow change \nin agriculture, the dominance of traditional marketing channels and the weak linkage \nbetween farm and fork.\n Economic reforms launched in 1991 helped in doubling real per capita ­income in \nthe country in just 17 years compared to 37 years it took to double per capita income \nbefore 1991. However, the gross value added (GVA) of agriculture and allied sectors \ndoubled in about 23 years before 1991, and it took same number of years to double \nagain. This is a major cause of rural distress. Special focus is needed to raise farmers’ \nincome at a faster rate. This requires transformation of agriculture production as well \nas marketing through a multi-pronged strategy that involves increase in productiv-\nity, reduction in average cost, better price realisation for farm produce, expansion of \nallied activities and shift of farmers to non-farm occupations. The three farm laws \nxix\nenacted in year 2020, which have been repealed now because of opposition from some \nfarmers groups, were aimed to achieve this goal.\nSince long, there is a felt need to overcome the limitations and constraints of the \npresent agricultural marketing system and to develop a competitive, transparent \nand barrier free markets with the choices to the farmers to sell their produce to the \nbuyers offering better prices in a transparent manner. When states did not come on \nboard to reform their Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts, despite \nrepeated pleas and persuasions by successive governments at the centre for 18 long \nyears, the union government in 2020 took a historical decision to take on itself the \n­responsibility of bringing reforms in agriculture, and the three new farm acts were \nenacted after they were passed by the Parliament. Consequently, the three farm laws \nhave been repealed ­because of farmers protest against these reforms. Nevertheless, it \nis very clear that the sector cannot move forward on a healthy pace without reforms.\nSome farmers’ groups demand legalising of MSP as a solution to low market ­prices. \nLegal MSP cannot work when they are not supported by demand and ­supply side \n­factors. If we want to protect the farmers against unremunerative or ­uncompetitive \nprices through legal MSP, we should be guided by the price ­recommended by \n­institutions like the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), and after \n­considering demand side factors and possible open market price.\nAgricultural economists and experts need to debate about  (a) what is remu-\nnerative prices for farmers and the best option for ensuring it without distortions in \n­market; (b) sharing of responsibility for price assurance between the centre and the \nstates; and, (c) the pathways for modernising agriculture. \nSignificant and sustained increase in farmers’ income and transformation of ­agriculture \nrequire a paradigm shift in the entire approach towards agriculture ­sector. Changes in \narchaic regulations and liberalisation of the sector are a must for ­creating an enabling en-\nvironment for a modern and vibrant agriculture. ­Advancement in ­science led technology, \nenhanced role of the private ­sector in both pre and ­postharvest phases, liberalised out-\nput markets, active land lease markets and emphasis on ­efficiency will equip ­agriculture \nto ­address the challenges of 21st century and ­contribute towards the goal of new India. \nA well-co-ordinated action and strategy between the centre and the states is needed to \n­ensure that agriculture moves to next stage of development along with other sectors. \nxx\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\n1. Introduction\nHistorical experience of almost all economies shows that the share of the \n­agriculture sector in the total employment and national income falls with the ­progress \nin economic development and growth over time. However, this ­decline does not \n­diminish the need to address various challenges facing the ­agriculture sector from \ntime to time because of several reasons. The foremost is the ­dependence of human life \non food for survival. This dependence goes beyond survival to adequate nutrition for \nan active and healthy life. The other significant reasons for the continuing importance \nof agriculture is its role in:\n(i) \t supporting and improving rural livelihoods, \n(ii) \t maintaining agro ecological balance, \n(iii) \tmitigating climate change and global warming, and \n(iv) \t ensuring sustainable use of land, water and other natural resources. \nMuch of the economic activities including industrial production and ­supply \nchains, trade and commerce start with raw material supplied by the agri-food ­sector. \nIt is, thus, obvious that agriculture remains a core concern in all the countries, both \n­developed and developing ones. It is now recognised by the United Nations that \n­Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 cannot be achieved without paying \nattention to agriculture, as 11 out of 17 SDGs are directly linked to agriculture.\nRole of agriculture in growth of Indian economy and overall development of the \ncountry hardly needs any elaboration. However, this needs to be re-­oriented in the light \nof the changing environment and requirements and to meet the new ­challenges, and \nalso to harness new opportunities. This will require a shift in our approach and ­thinking \ntowards agriculture from ‘pushing for incremental change’ to ­‘transformational change’. \n2. Agricultural Challenges\nThere is a sea change in food situation in the country since the 1960s when In-\ndia faced acute shortage of food and registered widespread hunger, and ­depended \n2\nRamesh Chand\non food imports to save millions of lives from starvation. The ­situation was so grave \nthat the then Prime Minister gave a call to the people to observe fast for one day \nin a week. The High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of wheat and ­paddy became available \naround the same time, and the then ­government took a bold decision to adopt Green \n­Revolution ­technology ­despite strong ­opposition from some quarters. The ­entire \n­agriculture ­strategy was ­focused on single ­motto of ‘grow more food’. Initially, the \nGreen ­Revolution ­technology ­involving high yielding dwarf varieties of wheat and \npaddy, ­highly responsive to ­inorganic fertilizer, was adopted in well-endowed ­irrigated \n­regions in the ­country. Subsequently, as irrigation expanded, the Green ­Revolution \n­technology spread to wider areas. Improved and HYV were also developed in many \nother crops.\nThe new cultivars were more water intensive, and their success required better \ntillage, good quality seeds, use of chemical fertilisers to meet ­nutrition requirements, \nand use of chemicals to control pests, insects, diseases and of late weeds. The Green \nRevolution technology was more beneficial and suitable for irrigated regions com-\npared to rainfed areas. These changes were ­facilitated and encouraged by favourable \npolicy support and environment both by the centre as well as many states. The spread \nof the new technology package led towards enterprise specialisation, mono cropping, \nshifts in cropping pattern and crop sequences, withdrawal of more nutrients from the \nsoil and more ­extraction of groundwater than recharge. This put serious stress on the \n­natural resource base (land, water, ecosystem and environment), and thereby, clear \nsignals emerged on the sacrifice of long-term interest for the short-term gains, and \nby future generation for current generation gains. It is now evident that the current \nsystem and practices need thorough changes and a paradigm shift. ­Before discussing \nthose changes, it is imperative to discuss the severity and extent of various types of \nchallenges facing Indian agriculture.\n2.1  Overexploitation of Water Resources\nAssured irrigation and access to water are crucial for raising crop ­productivity, \ncrop intensity and output quality, and lowering risks in ­agriculture. ­Expansion in \n­irrigation, along with technology and fertilizer, have been the ­major ­instruments \n­fuelling agriculture growth. Over time, huge ­public and ­private ­investment have \nbeen made to expand the area under ­irrigation. ­Seeing the critical role of water in \n­raising yields, some states started ­subsidising or ­supplying power for irrigation free \n3\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nof charges. This led to ­reckless, ­indiscriminate and overuse of water, and brought \nserious distortions in crop choices. With ­marginal cost of using water being close to \nzero, ­farmers started growing water intense crops in low rainfall areas and adopted \nwater-based practices and off-season cultivation. It is evident from the emergence of \nmonoculture of paddy in traditionally groundnut and cotton growing areas in Punjab, \nHaryana and Rajasthan; expansion of sugarcane in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh; \ngroundnut cultivation in peak summer time in Rajasthan and many such cases. Thus, \na new geography of crops appeared in complete violation of agro climatic suitability \nof various agro climatic zones in the country. Broad changes in area and sources of \nirrigation are presented in Table 1. \nThough half of the agricultural area is rainfed and without access to ­irrigation, \nthe sector uses close to 90% of the total water used in the country. Further, the \n­groundwater table show small to very high decline in 36% of the blocks mainly due to \nwater withdrawal exceeding water recharge. This is being experienced even in water \nrich middle Indo Gangetic region. Farmers in some parts of the country are chasing \ngroundwater beyond 1,000 feet below ground level. This is water mining, and has \nvery serious implications for water quality, aquifer health and availability of water in \nfuture.\n2.2  Disregard for Nature and Loss of Crop Diversity\nThe guiding principle and recommendations for crops suitable for different ­regions \nare available in literature on Agro Climatic Regional Planning (ACRP) ­published by \nTable 1: Changes in Irrigation and Status of Groundwater\n  Irrigation/Water use\t\nTE 1972-73\t TE 2017-18\nGross irrigated area (million hectare)\t\n38.6\t\n98.3\nGross cropped area irrigated (%)\t\n23.5\t\n49.4\nGroundwater irrigated area in total irrigated area (%)\t\n28.2\t\n46.0\nOverexploitation of ground water (% blocks) \t\n\t\n36.0\nShare of agriculture in total water use (%)\t\n\t\n88.8\nNote: \t\nTE stands for Triennium Ending\nSource: \t 1.\tDirectorate of Economics and Statistics, Land Use Statistics, Ministry of \t\t\n\t\n\t\nAgriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi.

The \n­suggested crops and crop pattern are based on ­natural resource endowment and agro-\nclimatic conditions prevailing in ­various parts of the country, and are thus ­considered \nsustainable. Actual crop pattern and acreage allocated to various crops are at signifi-\ncant variance with what is ­suitable from the agro climatic point of view. The deviation \nis mainly caused by policy support and disparities in advancement in ­technology for \nvarious crops. Technological and policy bias in favour of Green ­Revolution ­technology \nand a few crops not only caused distortions in crop pattern, it also resulted in ­increased \nconcentration of area under some crops and a sharp decline in crop ­diversity. This is \nillustrated in Table 2. In the early 1970s, paddy cultivation was undertaken on 10.8% \nof the net sown area in Punjab and 8% in Haryana. This share has increased to 73.3% \nin Punjab and 39.5% in Haryana. Similarly, area under sugarcane cultivation qua-\ndrupled in Maharashtra and doubled in Uttar Pradesh  after the onset of the Green \nRevolution.\nSuch changes in crop pattern have serious implication for sustainable use of ­natural \nresources, complementarity among crops, outbreak of diseases and pests. These \n­consequences are also transmitted to human health and nutrition, and ­environment",

Accessed from: https://eands.dacnet.nic.in/#\n5\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\n2.3  Low Efficiency and Price Led Growth\nIndia’s growth in agriculture sector, though impressive in most products and \nstates, has remained lower than the potential. Our productivity levels are lower than \nmajor agricultural countries. The sector is witnessing slow ­modernisation. The much-\nneeded changes in technology, method of ­production and ­postharvest value addition \nare not visible on a large scale. Agricultural practices involving prolific use of inputs \nlike broadcasting of fertilizer and flood irrigation are not showing any significant \n­improvement. In most of the crops, increase in productivity has been accompanied \nby an increase in average cost of production, which necessitates an increase in out-\nput prices to keep incremental production profitable. The dependence of the agricul-\nture sector on government support is rising. Because of this, the sector is losing its \n­competitiveness.  \nThe role of incentives like output price support and subsidies, and non-price ­factors \nlike irrigation, new seed, fertilizer, technology and institutional ­reforms in improving \nthe growth of the agriculture sector is very well documented in the ­literature. While \nnon-price factors create potential for growth, remunerative ­prices ­incentivise farm-\ners to harness this potential. Thus, both sets of ­measures are ­crucial for growth and \ndevelopment of the agriculture ­sector. Over time, ­farmers have ­focused more on prices \nsupport than making a ­balanced demand to include non-price factors in policy sup-\nport. This was ­because of a couple of factors. Implementation of MSP and procurement \nof rice and wheat in selected states allowed remarkable stability in prices received by \nfarmers with zero price risk, and assured higher income than through their sale at \nmarket prices. This attracted attention of other producers, who were not able to sell \ntheir crops at MSP, for a similar treatment to them and their crops. And also, MSP \nhas been made more and more remunerative over time, and increased year after year \nirrespective of glut in supply and fluctuations in open market or ­international prices. \nAfter submission of report of National Commission on Farmers, chaired by \n­eminent agriculture scientist Dr M S Swaminathan, in 2006, farmers have rallied \naround the commission recommendation for a 50% margin over costs while fixing \nMSP. This recommendation was a surprise for many economists, as the ­commission \ndid not give any rationale or justification for this recommendation that has far-\nreaching implications. The recommendation became quite popular among farmers \nthroughout the country, as it involves a high rate of return over their cost. Political \n6\nRamesh Chand\nparties also started promising MSP based on the Swaminathan Commission report to \nappease and seek farmers’ support. The decision of the central government to accept \nSwaminathan Committee recommendation to fix MSP at least 50% above the cost of \nproduction in 2018 ­further raised the attractiveness of MSP and pushed the MSPs \nmuch above open market prices. Increase in average costs of cultivation due to higher \nuse of inputs has forced the farmers to rely more on support prices, though increased \nuse of inputs has improved crop productivity.\nChanges in prices of agriculture relative to prices in the non-agriculture sector \ncan be seen from the terms of trade (TOT) for agriculture. The TOT is taken as ratio of \nimplicit price deflator of agriculture sector to implicit price ­deflator of non-agriculture \nsector. Generally, TOT is expected to move ­cyclically with the phase of rise followed \nby the phase of decline, and vice versa. But since 2005-06, TOT for agriculture have \nmoved on a rising trend (Figure 1). This implies that price trends have been more \n­favourable towards farmers’ output since 2005-06.\n2.4  Imbalances and Regional Disparities\nImbalances between demand and domestic production have been growing over the \nyears. India has been accumulating a large surplus of rice, wheat and sugar, and this in-\nFigure 1: Movement in Terms of Trade for Agriculture \n \n \n    Note:  \nTerms of trade for agriculture is the ratio of implicit price deflator of gross value added (GVA) of \nagriculture to that of the non-agriculture sectors. \n    Source:  Author’s calculation based on data derived from National Statistical Office: National Accounts Statistics, \nMinistry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, New Delhi, Various Issues. \n \n0.0\n20.0\n40.0\n60.0\n80.0\n100.0\n120.0\n140.0\n1970-71\n1972-73\n1974-75\n1976-77\n1978-79\n1980-81\n1982-83\n1984-85\n1986-87\n1988-89\n1990-91\n1992-93\n1994-95\n1996-97\n1998-99\n2000-01\n2002-03\n2004-05\n2006-07\n2008-09\n2010-11\n2012-13\n2014-15\n2016-17\n2018-19\nTerms of trade for agriculture\nYear\n7\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nvolves a huge cost to the state exche-",

Though some \nvariations are bound to be there because of natural resource endowment and access \nto irrigation, there are wide variations in crop productivity across states even at a \nsimilar level of irrigation. As can be seen from Table 3, value of crops harvested from \none hectare of land in major states varies between Rs. 70,977 in Rajasthan and Rs. \n2.83 lakh in West Bengal. Excluding Rajasthan, which has very low rainfall and dry \nand arid climate, per hectare productivity across major states ranges in the ratio of \n1:3.1. With more than 72% area under irrigation, Bihar achieved crop productivity of \nRs. 1.38 lakh per hectare – lower than average of many other states where area under \nirrigation is less than 50%.\n2.5  Wasteful Investment\nInvestment in major, medium and micro irrigation constitutes a major share \nof public investment in agriculture. These investment were meant to increase area \nunder surface water irrigation. The country spent more than Rs. 30,000 crore each \nyear after 2007-08 as capital expenditure and also ­a huge amount as operation and \nmaintenance of canals, but area under canal irrigation is showing either stagnation \nor decline (Figure 2). There are ­multiple ­reasons for this, including considerable \nFigure 2: Area under Canal Irrigation and Its Share in Total Irrigated Area,  \nAll-India \n \n \n          Source: Same as Table 1. \n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\n35.0\n40.0\n45.0\n10000\n11000\n12000\n13000\n14000\n15000\n16000\n17000\n18000\n19000\nCanal irrigation as % of NIA\nCanal irrigated area (000ha)\nTotal\nCanal irrigation as % of NIA\n9\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\n­delays in completion of projects ­resulting in very high time and cost overruns. Several \n­major irrigation projects even ­after ­incurring most of the expenditure are held up by \n­minor obstacles like ­forest clearance in small pockets, catchment area development, \n­construction of ­distributaries and field channels. Interstate and intra state ­disputes \nare ­another factor for delay in completion of some major irrigation works. \nIt looks ironical that area under canal irrigation witnessed stagnation and even \ndecline for such a long period, despite so much investment in medium and ­major \n­irrigation. During 1993-2014, the country spent on an average about Rs. 17,663 \ncrore per year at current prices on capital expenditure for major and medium irriga-\ntion projects. This disquieting trend necessitates closer examination and ­urgent ac-\ntion to ensure that the country’s resources spent on canal irrigation gives expected \nreturn.\nThe main reason for lack of progress in the area under canal irrigation has been \npoor utilisation of irrigation potential created, and emergence of a big gap between \n­irrigation potential created (IPC) and irrigation potential utilised (IPU). This is \n­despite the fact that Rs. 1,74,473 crore were spend on major and medium irrigation \nprojects in the Eleventh five year plan period. Though IPU remained poor, even this \nshould have resulted in an increase in the area under ­canal irrigation, which is not \nvisible in the irrigation statistics.  \nDue to poor progress in the area under canal irrigation, its share in the net irri-\ngated area has declined from 37.5% in 1984-85 to 23% during 2018-19. This, in turn, \nis putting strong pressure on use of groundwater leading to its overexploitation, which \nhas several adverse implications.\n2.6  Technology Generation and Dissemination\nAgricultural problems are becoming more complex, and research is ­turning more \ncapital intensive. Climate change, share of agriculture in greenhouse emissions and \nsustainability concerns add to the challenges to be addressed by the research and \n­development (R&D) system. Scope for spillover from ­research in the developed world \nis shrinking, and intellectual property right (IPR) ­issues are complicating and making \nit costly for transfer of technology from the outside world and the private sector. Thus, \nIndia needs to be self-reliant in ­agricultural research. \n10\nRamesh Chand\nBasic and strategic research in any discipline lays the foundation for break-\nthroughs. Sadly, this component has weakened considerably in the National Agricul-\ntural Research System (NARS). The concentration of NARS over a ­period of time has \nshifted to applied research and problem-solving research. \nAgriculture is also becoming more competitive globally with many new ­innovations \nhappening in the sector. However, the rate of adoption of improved as well as frontier \ntechnology is low, mainly due to poor extension services. \nThough agricultural research and higher education is largely a ­responsibility of \nState Agriculture Universities (SAUs), the ICAR is required to respond to any chal-\nlenges and issues concerning the agriculture sector. Public opinion at large holds \nICAR responsible for any adverse development in the agriculture sector. As a result, \nthe portfolio of ICAR has been getting bigger and bigger over time. Load of ICAR has \nrisen manifold with the responsibility to expand frontline extension and operate Kri-\nshi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) throughout the ­country. Many questions are raised about \nthe effectiveness of ICAR in fulfilling the ­larger role it has been assuming over the \nyears and expected to play in the field of agriculture R&D and education.\n2.7  Viability of Smallholders\nAgriculture in India and most of Asian countries is dominated by small land hold-\nings. According to Agricultural Census for year 2015-16, 68% farm holdings operate \non less than 1 hectare land area. Further, 85% of farm households undertake farming \non less than 2 hectares. This size of land holding does not generate adequate income \nwith the usual agricultural practices and ­products. Thus, two options are left to raise \nincome of such farm holdings. One, enable these farmers to go for high value crops \nand livestock activities, where they can make optimum use of their family work force. \nAnd, two, supplement agriculture income with income from non-agriculture sources \nlike wages and salaries, some kind of business and trade. Small holders also face the \n­problem of scale economy in input as well as output markets that require different \ntype of institutional help. \n2.8  Nutrition, Food Safety and Health\nIndia’s nutrition indicators and child health indicators are low. ­According to the \nFood and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, the largest number \n11\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nof people who are hungry or undernourished live in India. ­According to the Global \nHunger Index, an annual publication of two non-­government ­organisations (NGOs), \nnamely, the Concern Worldwide and ­Welthungerhilfe, India ranks low year after year \non the hunger indices, even though the ­country has become the largest rice exporting \ncountry with about 15% of its rice ­production sold in overseas market. Since 1970-71, \nfood ­production in the ­country has ­increased at trend rate close to 3%, while popula-\ntion growth in the same ­period was 1.86%. Further, growth rate in food production has \n­remained in tact in the recent years, whereas population growth rate has ­decelerated. \nClearly, per ­capita production of food has witnessed exponential growth. ­India is also \n­having an excess stock of rice and wheat for many years in a row. ­Recently, a huge \nsurplus of sugar has also accumulated. According to some observers, ­India represents \na paradoxical situation of ‘hunger in the midst of plenty’.\nIndian diets are undergoing diversification in a significant manner. Per capita \n­absorption of cereals has witnessed the smallest increase, despite an increase in their \nTable 4: Food Supply Per Capita Kg/Year\n  Commodity\t\nIndia\t\nChina\n\t\nTE 1982\t\nTE 2013\t\nTE 2018\t\nTE 1982\t\nTE 2013\t\nTE 2018\n  Cereals\t\n144.7\t\n148.7\t\n182.0\t\n160.0\t\n150.4\t\n192.7\n  Pulses\t\n12.0\t\n14.1\t\n15.1\t\n4.6\t\n1.4\t\n1.4\n  Edible oil\t\n5.1\t\n8.7\t\n9.5\t\n3.4\t\n7.7\t\n8.2\n  Sugar\t\n19.3\t\n22.9\t\n22.8\t\n5.7\t\n7.1\t\n8.0\n  Milk\t\n40.6\t\n84.7\t\n101.6\t\n3.2\t\n32.6\t\n22.8\n  Eggs\t\n0.7\t\n2.5\t\n3.1\t\n2.7\t\n18.6\t\n19.8\n  Meat & Fish\t\n6.2\t\n8.5\t\n10.8\t\n6.9\t\n43.6\t\n99.8\n  Onion\t\n3.1\t\n12.6\t\n13.8\t\n3.2\t\n13.8\t\n14.6\n  Potato\t\n9.1\t\n23.9\t\n25.5\t\n9.7\t\n41.0\t\n41.7\n  Tomato\t\n2.1\t\n12.8\t\n13.5\t\n5.0\t\n29.7\t\n34.8\n  All vegetables\t\n57.4\t\n108.6\t\n87.7\t\n65.6\t\n382.2\t\n360.2\n  Citrus\t\n2.2\t\n6.1\t\n8.0\t\n1.2\t\n21.3\t\n24.14\n  Fruits\t\n23.1\t\n47.2\t\n59.2\t\n6.6\t\n69.0\t\n97.6\nNotes: \t 1. \tFood supply represent the quantity used for food purpose, directly or indirectly. \n \t\n2.

This is consistent with ­dietary ­diversification seen in \nother countries where per capita income has also risen (Table 4). There is a manifold \nincrease in per capita net availability of ­vegetables, and doubling of fruits and milk \navailable for domestic food use. Per capita availability of domestic edible oils increased \nby 60% in the three decades since the early 1980s. Similar changes are seen in the food \nbalance sheet of ­China. ­However, there is a big difference in the growth and the level of \nper ­capita ­supply of horticultural and livestock products between these two countries.  \nDuring the early 1980s, per capita supply of eggs and meat products in ­India was \nclose to China. In the next three decades, supply of these items in China became five \ntimes that of India. Along with higher ­level of eggs and meat products, the Chinese \nuse three times the vegetables and 80% more fruits than those by Indians. The data \non food supply shows that though there is large shift towards horticultural and live-\nstock products use in India, the increase is smaller compared to China, where nutri-\ntion and child and ­maternity health have improved considerably. \n2.9  Mismatch between Structural Changes in Output and Workforce\nAs an economy develops, the share of agriculture in national gross ­value added \n(GVA), a measure of national income, and employment would experience a ­decline. \nHigher the growth of the economy, faster is the transformation in the structure of \neconomy. In India, between 1950-51 and 1970-71, the share of ­agriculture in national \nincome at 2011-12 prices declined from 61.7% to 49.6%, whereas the sector’s share in \nemployment remained stuck at more than 69% (Table 5). In the next two decades, the \nsector’s share in employment declined to 59% and income to 35.1%. After 1990-91, \nTable 5: Share of Agriculture including Allied Activities in Workforce and National \nIncome Since 1950-51 (in %)\n  Year\t\nShare in\t\nShare in National Income\n\t\nWorkforce\t\nAt Constant Prices\t\nAt Current Prices\n  1950-51\t\n69.2\t\n61.7\t\n53.2\n  1970-71\t\n69.7\t\n49.6\t\n43.1\n  1990-91\t\n59.0\t\n35.1\t\n29.8\n  2010-11\t\n54.6\t\n18.3\t\n18.4\n  2019-20\t\n45.6\t\n14.8\t\n18.4\nSource:  1. \tShare in Workforce - Population Census except for year 2019-20 which was taken \n\t\n\t\t from National Statistics Office (2021a). \n\t\n2.\tShare in National Income – same as Figure 1.\n13\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\ngrowth rate of economy accelerated which also resulted in faster decline in the share of \nagriculture. However, the decline in the share of agriculture in work force did not keep \npace with the decline in the sector’s share in national income. In ­2010-11, ­agriculture \nhad a share of 18.3% and 54.6%, respectively, in national income and ­employment. \nThe latest data estimated by Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2019-20 shows \nthat agriculture sector as a whole (that is, including fishery and ­forestry) provide em-\nployment as the principal occupation to 45.6 % of the total work force in the ­country \n­(National Statistical Office 2021a). In the same year, ­agriculture share in GVA at \n­current prices was 18.4%. Thus, there is a need to pull workforce out of agriculture \nto enhance the per worker income in the ­sector. ­However, it is increasingly getting \n­difficult to get adequate alternate jobs, especially in industry, for shifting the work-\nforce out of agriculture. This calls for a new strategy for employment.\n2.10  Low Income of Farmers\nDisproportionate share of agriculture in national income and employment im-\nplies disparity in per worker income in agriculture and non-­agriculture ­sector. At the \nmacro level, income per worker in non-agriculture is 3.75 times the income of an aver-\nage agriculture worker which includes agricultural ­labourers and cultivators. Lately, \nthe Prime Minister has repeatedly called for focusing attention on raising farmers’ \nincome. However, the small and shrinking land size, excess workforce, low produc-\ntivity and poorly working markets are the main causes for low per farmer income in \nthe country. Besides focusing on ­raising income from farming, there is a pressing \nneed for enhancing avenues for agricultural households to earn income from non-\nfarm sources. \n3. Policies for 21st Century\nThe present government has set a vision for a new India that involves ­‘Sabka \nSaath Sabka Vikas’. Transformation of the agriculture sector is ­crucial for ­achieving \nthis vision, as 45% of the workforce in the country is employed and dependent on \nagriculture for their livelihood (National Statistical Office 2021a). There is a large \ngap ­between income of agriculture workers and non-agriculture workers (Chand et \nal 2015; Chand 2019). Poverty and undernutrition in the country are concentrated \namong agricultural labour and small and marginal farmers. There is a lot of concern \n14\nRamesh Chand\nrelating to rural distress. If ­current trends in agriculture are not changed, there will \nbe little improvement in ­reducing the income gap between agriculture and non-agri-\nculture income, and alleviating rural distress. \nIt has been empirically demonstrated that agriculture growth is ­significantly ben-\neficial for reducing poverty and increasing per capita incomes (Virmani 2008). Beside \ninclusive growth, agriculture matters for health and nutrition, sustainability, climate \nchange and quality of life. All these factors underscore the need for a new vision for \nagriculture, as we move forward in the 21st century – a vision that addresses various \nchallenges presented in Section I above. This section discusses and suggests policy \nchanges and reforms needed for transformation of agriculture to help achieving the \naspiration of India of the 21st century.  The discussion is organised under following \nthemes:\n1. \t Growth and efficiency\n2. \t R&D and innovations\n3. \t Employment generation for decent jobs\n4. \t Food security, nutrition and health\n5. \t Surplus management\n6. \t Input intensive to knowledge intensive agriculture\n7. \t Climate change and sustainability\n8. \t Responsible investments in agriculture\n9. \t Farmers’ income\n10. \tReforms in policies and regulations affecting agriculture\n3.1  Growth and Efficiency\nSince 1970-71, agricultural output and value added have moved on a growth \n­trajectory of around 3.0% for most of the period. Recent years have seen an accelera-\ntion in the growth rate. It may appear strange that high growth rate in agriculture \nexperienced during some phases did not bring down real prices of food in the country. \n15\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nThe reason has been that the prices drove output growth rather than output growth \ndetermining prices! Some studies on this aspect also show that during the period of \nhigh agriculture growth (above 4%), much of the growth was driven by an increase in \nagricultural prices (Chand 2014; Chand and Parapurathu 2012; Chand et al 2015). The \nstrong association between agricultural prices and growth suggests that if agricul-\ntural prices do not rise faster than other prices, the growth rate of agriculture is likely \nto fall, which then becomes a major cause for agrarian distress, and thus, the economy \nas a whole. Formidable and foremost policy challenges to achieve efficient growth are:\n(i) \t\nhow to sustain agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise \nbeyond acceptable limits? \n(ii) \t how to incentivise farmers to raise production without causing hardship to \nconsumers? \nThe answer seems to be change in our goal and strategy from ‘growth to ­efficient \ngrowth’. This requires upgradation of agricultural technology, ­application of modern \nskills in farm practices, new innovation in farming, and lowering wastages in use \nof fertilizer, water and other inputs. This will also require change in input pricing \npolicy to discourage prolific and indiscriminate use of inputs like water and fertiliser, \nand promote their optimum use. Digital technology can also play a significant role \nin improving efficiency through easy dissemination of technology and knowledge to \nfarmers. \nSupply of low quality and spurious inputs is an important factor for ­increased \ncost without adequate gain in productivity. Thus, beside ­emphasising use of modern \ninputs, there is a need to put in place an effective mechanism for monitoring and regu-\nlating quality of inputs like seeds, fertilisers and ­agro-chemicals.\nRising cost of production associated with modern technology is ­moving the atten-\ntion towards alternative methods of farming. Methods that are ­rooted in traditional \nIndian methods of farming, like natural farming and organic ­farming, are proposed \nin place of chemical-based farming with the aim to reduce cost of production, beside \naddressing adverse effects of chemicals on health, environment and natural ­resources. \nLots of anecdotal evidence is quoted in support of benefits of ­alternative ­system of \nfarming. However, the scientific community in public research ­institutes cast doubts \n16\nRamesh Chand\non the claim of benefits of traditional system of ­farming and raise the issue of sig-\nnificant yield discount in such methods, which could be detrimental to the food and \nnutrition security of the country in the ­coming years (NAAS 2019). They feel, a break-\nthrough in biotechnology and ­scientific ­practices like integrated pest management \n(IPM) and integrated plant ­nutrient (IPN) systems, modern method of fertiliser ap-\nplication and ­irrigation can ­address the various concerns related to farming, based on \nthe use of agro-chemicals rather than taking the risk of shift towards natural ­farming. \n­Notwithstanding this ­debate, public opinion is growing in favour of safe, healthy and \nenvironmentally sustainable food production. It is high time that public research \n­system looks in-depth into various aspects of alternative ­methods of farming and de-\nvelop best methods to meet public preferences and national goals of raising farmers’ \nincome by lowering costs, and supply of safe and healthy food. \n3.2  R&D and Innovation\nEfficiency is driven by strong and vibrant R&D by public or private ­sector. Public \nsector R&D in the country is suffering from resource constraint, ­disciplinary frag-\nmentations, and lack of drive and inspiration. At the same time, fascinating innova-\ntion and changes in agriculture are being seen in ­developed world institutions and in \nprivate sector. Private sector investment in agri R&D in India is also low due to the \nnature of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) ­regime in the ­country. ­Consequently, the \ngap between domestic and global ­agricultural innovations is rising, and many fasci-\nnating changes ­experienced in global ­agriculture are missing in the country. In the \nabsence of domestic R&D ­attaining global ­standard, agriculture is losing its competi-\ntive edge. There is a need to facilitate easy access to our farmers to global ­technology, \nhigh ­quality seeds and germplasm, and other knowledge products.\nApplication of biotechnology in agriculture through genetic breakthrough and \n­genetic enhancement is playing an important role in shaping the future of agriculture. \nAgri biotechnology in India has occupied a backseat after the ­restrictions ­imposed \non field testing and non-release of Bt brinjal. The ­countries which have embraced \n­genetically modified and genetically edited technology are gaining advantage in \nterms of productivity and cost. A comparison of the trends in productivity of soy-\nbean and maize in India and in those countries which have adopted biotech crops \npresents a stark example of competitive ­advantage gained by the latter through agri \n­biotechnology (Figures 3a & 3b). India will face very tough competition from biotech \n17\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\ncrops, which are leading to higher yield and lower average cost, if the country does not \nupgrade technology in such crops. \nBasic and strategic research in any discipline lays the foundation for breakthroughs. \nThis component has weakened considerably in NARS. The concentration of NARS \nFigure 3a: Soyabean Yield/Hectare in India, USA, Argentina and World \n \n \n                  Source: Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAOSTAT.

Thus, to have breakthrough in \nagricultural R&D and technology and to have science driven growth, we need to create \na new set of research institutions in agriculture on the pattern of ­Indian Institute of \nTechnology, Indian Institute of Management and Indian Institute of ­Science.  \nThe most important concern voiced by ICAR and SAUs is inadequate ­funding for \nresearch. On the other hand, state after state have been setting up new ­universities \ngenerally by fragmenting the existing structure to have ­separate universities for \n­Animal Sciences, Horticulture, Fishery, etc. ­Similarly, ICAR is also setting up some \nnew ­institutes to address new areas. Lack of ­adequate budgetary support and expan-\nsion of institutions are damaging the inter ­disciplinary nature of agricultural ­research, \ncreating turf conflicts, ­hampering research and lowering the morale of ­scientists. \nWe must put a stop to the growth of new institutes under NARS, particularly those \nwhich result in fragmentation of agriculture and allied disciplines. There is a need to \n­improve quality of institutions rather than just raising their number.\n3.3  Employment Generation for Decent Jobs\nTraditional theories of economic transformation clearly established that the share \nof agriculture in national income and total employment declines with the ­economic \ndevelopment. This has been experienced by the most of the countries even in the \n­recent times (Table 6). This transition has been slow in the case of India, particularly \nin respect of the share of agriculture in the total workforce. Between 1991 and 2019, \nthe share of agriculture in workforce declined by less than a half in Brazil, China, and \nMalaysia. Labour share of agriculture in ­Vietnam declined by nearly 30 percentage \npoints. As per the World Bank data, the decline has been much smaller in the case of \nTable 6: Agriculture Sector’s Share in National Income and Employment in Selected \nDeveloping Countries, 1991 and 2019\n \t\nShare in National Income (in %)\t\nShare in Employment (in %)\n  Country\t\n1991\t\n2019\t\n1991\t\n2019\nBrazil\t\n6.8\t\n4.4\t\n22.4\t\n9.1\nChina\t\n24.0\t\n7.1\t\n59.7\t\n25.3\nIndia\t\n27.3\t\n16.7\t\n63.0\t\n42.3\nMalaysia\t\n14.4\t\n7.3\t\n22.0\t\n10.3\nVietnam\t\n40.5\t\n14.0\t\n68.6\t\n37.2\nSource:  World Bank, World Development Indicators. Accessed from www.worldbank.org\n19\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nIndia. This has created serious structural imbalances between sectoral composition \nof output and ­employment (Table 6). The primary reason for this is the failure of the \nindustrial sector to attract and accommodate labour force from agriculture. \nRecent developments in technology like automation, artificial ­intelligence (AI), \nbig data, internet of things (IOT) and machine learning are further ­restricting the \ncapacity of non-agriculture sector to absorb the workforce from agriculture. This has \nput renewed focus on agriculture to create gainful ­employment in postharvest value \naddition activities.\nEmpirical evidence from successive surveys on employment and labour use since \n2004-05 reveals significant changes in rural and agricultural workforce (Table 7), \nwhich have important implications for agriculture and the economy. There is large \nscale withdrawal by female labour from agriculture ­(cultivators as well as ­labourers) in \ncontrast to the popular perception of ­feminisation of ­agriculture. Moreover, the with-\ndrawal from agriculture by cultivators has sharply decelerated after 2011-12, while \nshift of agricultural labour from the ­sector has accelerated. This necessitates support \nfor mechanisation on smallholder farms. The concerns about the threat to ­agriculture \ndue to youth not staying in agriculture is belied by NSO’s Periodic ­Labour-Force \n­Surveys ­(National Statistical Office 2021a).\nAn important reason for the slow shift of farm youths to non-agriculture sec-\ntor is their strong preference for middle income jobs. But, in many cases, required \nTable 7: Changes in Cultivators and Agricultural Labour in Rural India\n(Million)\n  Year \t\nCultivators\t\nAgricultural Labour\t\nAgricultural Workforce\n\t\nMale\t Female\t Total\t\nMale\t\nFemale\t\nTotal\t\nMale\t Female\t Total\n  1993-94\t\n85\t\n53\t\n138\t\n54\t\n37\t\n91\t\n139\t\n90\t\n229\n  2004-05\t\n93\t\n67\t\n160\t\n53\t\n37\t\n89\t\n146\t\n103\t\n249\n  2011-12\t\n91\t\n49\t\n140\t\n48\t\n27\t\n75\t\n139\t\n76\t\n215\n  2017-18\t\n102\t\n37\t\n138\t\n30\t\n20\t\n50\t\n131\t\n56\t\n188\n  2018-19\t\n100\t\n41\t\n140\t\n29\t\n19\t\n49\t\n129\t\n60\t\n188\n  2019-20\t\n108\t\n58\t\n165\t\n33\t\n24\t\n57\t\n141\t\n81\t\n222\nSource: \tAuthor’s calculation based on data derived from:\n\t\n1.

Population Census of India and projected population.\n20\nRamesh Chand\nskill and capability for such jobs is missing. Medium, small and micro enterprises \n(MSME), which are labour intensive, seem to be an appropriate alternative for rural \n­employment generation. Linking agri-food processing to production through efficient \nvalue chains, contract farming and direct ­linkage between factory and farm offer a \nconsiderable scope for rural employment ­generation as well as for raising farmers’ \nincome.\nIn the wake of capital intensive production preferred by the manufacturing sector \nand anticipated threats to jobs posed by emerging technological ­innovations, there is a \nneed for a rethink on pursuing traditional development ­strategy of shifting workforce \nfrom agriculture to manufacturing and services. India should explore ­possibilities of \ncreating blue collar jobs in and around agriculture. This also looks desirable, as there \nis a serious shortage of skilled workers in agriculture (Bajar and Mushtaq 2019). \nThe reasons for workers preferring to move from agriculture to non-­agriculture are \nrelatively low wages in agriculture, stress of manual work and irregular ­employment. \nThese three problems can be addressed by innovative approaches in agriculture produc-\ntion and postharvest activities. These can be harnessed by developing and ­promoting \nnew farm models centred on the knowledge- and skill-based agriculture and the post-\nharvest value addition at the farm itself (Chand et al 2017). Pradhan ­Mantri Kaushal \nVikas Yojana ­(PMKVY) can play a major role in this by ­promoting and ­imparting skills \n­required in modern agriculture, value addition and primary ­processing.\n3.4  Food Security, Nutrition and Health\nPer capita food production in India has risen steadily over the last decades, from \nlittle more than 1 kg per person per day in the early 1980s to 1.73 kg in recent years. \nHowever, some health and nutrition indicators are awfully poor. ­According to Fifth \n­National Family Health Survey 2021, two-third of the ­children below the age of 5 years, \nand 57% of women are found to be ­anaemic. ­Similarly, the proportion of ­underweight \nand stunted children, and child ­mortality are higher in India compared to many other \nsouth Asian countries. What is more worrying is that some of these health indicators \nhave shown a deterioration between 2015-16 and 2019-20 (Table 8). ­Concerned with \nthe ­situation, the Government of India has launched several ­measures to improve \nhealth and nutrition especially of children and women. Increasing nutrition density \nthrough biofortification of food can play an important role in this. \n21\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nLow intake of the total food is the main reason for the widespread hunger and \nmalnutrition. The country would need to relook at policy interventions in agriculture \nthat are heavily biased towards rice, wheat and sugar, which are produced in excess of \ndomestic and export demand.\nSome studies show that even among economically well-off households, ­incidence \nof undernutrition and underweight children is quite common (Chand and ­Jumarani \n2013). Addressing all these concerns requires a close ­coordination between the \n­strategy for food production and health. Further, ­nutrition ­awareness is very ­important \nto ­improve nutrition and health, as ­rising ­preference towards spicy, oily and ­sugary \nfoods is the major cause for poor ­nutrition rather than non-availability of ­nutritive \nfood. Attributing poor nutrition entirely to low paying capacity is not correct.\nBeside food intake, health and absorption of nutrients by body are also ­affected by \nuse of clean water, sanitation and hygiene, and balanced and ­diversified diet. Creating \nawareness about nutrition is crucial for improving health outcomes.\nFood safety is emerging as a major concern, as there are overwhelming ­reports \nof excessive and unsafe use of chemicals and hormones in crops, livestock and fish \nfood, and presence of chemical residue in food. This requires strict regulation and \nits enforcement in both at the production stage and in postharvest stages. Awareness \nshould be created amongst producers, middlemen in the value chain and processors \nabout safe agro chemicals and methods of their usage in the entire food system and \nfood chain.\nNew interest has emerged in therapeutic values of food and its proper ­usages for \nmaintaining immunity against various ailments and diseases and for good health. As \nTable 8: Child and Women Health Indicators at All-India Level: 2015-16 and 2019-20\nParticular\t\n2015-16\t\n2019-20\nAll women aged 15-49 years who are anaemic (%)\t\n53.1\t\n57.0\nChildren aged < 5 anaemic %\t\n58.6\t\n67.1\nUnder-five mortality rate (U5MR)\t\n49.7\t\n41.9\nChildren under 5 years who are stunted %\t\n38.4\t\n35.5\nChildren under 5 years who are underweight %\t\n21.0\t\n19.3\nChildren under 5 years who are wasted %\t\n35.8\t\n32.1\nFAO: Prevalence of undernourishment (percent)\t\n14.7\t\n15.3\nSource: National Family Health Survey -5 and 4, Indian Institute of Population Sciences, Mumbai.\n22\nRamesh Chand\na result, demand for medicinal plants and varieties with specific ­attributes is on the \nrise. Some startups are linking consumers and ­producers for supply of such products. \nSupply of such products on a large scale will ­require value chain with traceability and \nlabelling.  \n3.5  Surplus Management\nAs discussed above, domestic absorption of food has grown at a lower rate than \ndomestic production. In the early 1980s, India produced and consumed a little more \nthan 1 kg food per person per day. The production has gradually increased to 1.73 kg in \nrecent years, whereas domestic absorption increased to 1.59 kg (Figure 4). This shows \nthat food surplus (domestic production less d­omestic absorption) has been continu-\nously increasing for the last 35 years. This requires a complete shift in food policy \nfrom shortage management to ­surplus management. This also indicates that much of \nthe under nutrition in India is not due to non-availability of food, but it is due to low \nfood intake. India has to look for overseas market to dispose the surplus food produce. \nAgriculture production in the country is growing at a trend rate of above 3% per \nyear. Domestic demand is projected to rise by about 2.3%. Therefore, the surplus \nFigure 4: Per Capita Food Production and Domestic Absorption,  \n1980-83 to 2016-17 \n \n \nSource: Author’s calculation based on data derived from Department of Economics and Statistics, Agricultural \nStatistics At A Glance, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi, \nVarious Issues. \n \n1.05\n1.18\n1.25\n1.60\n1.73\n1.04\n1.14\n1.19\n1.49\n1.59\n1.00\n1.10\n1.20\n1.30\n1.40\n1.50\n1.60\n1.70\n1.80\n1980 to 83\n1990 to 93\n2000 to 03\n2010 to 13\n2016-17\nPer Capita food production and demand\nYear\nFood production/person/day Kg\nDemand\n23\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\navailable for export will further grow in the coming years, and India will be required \nto sell a higher proportion of domestic production in overseas market. With the same \ntrend in growth of food output, India will need to add 20% - 25% of incremental out-\nput to current level of food export. This requires export competitiveness and action in \nthree following areas:\n• \t prices in primary markets should be sufficiently lower than ­international \n­prices.\n• \t price spread in various stages of marketing should be reduced.\n• \t producers should be integrated with global value chains. \nAt present, the MSP of some commodities recommended by the ­government are \nhigher than the international prices. In such a ­situation, if MSP is ­implemented through \nthe system of procurement, it will keep ­domestic ­prices higher than ­international \nprices, making exports impossible. ­Experience of many countries, also of late China, \nshows that paying higher than open ­market prices to farmers through procurement \ncannot be sustained. Fixing prices ­higher than open market price attract imports \neven for exportable and ­commodities that are surplus. More focus on supply than on \ndemand is ­justified as long as demand is ahead of supply. Once demand falls short of \nsupply, the guiding principle for price intervention should be open market price or \ndemand side factor. \nRising surplus and export dependence for its disposal underline a strong need \nto let market forces to determine prices of produce. Keeping prices ­artificially above \nthe level dictated by demand and supply and thrusting them on the ­market through \ngovernment intervention causes serious price ­distortions, which have a number of \n­implications. On the other hand, MSPs are considered important to ensure remu-\nnerative prices for the farmers. The best option to deal with such situations is to pay \nto farmers the difference between ­reasonable MSP and average market price at the \nstate level, as is the practice in many countries, rather than distorting market prices \nthrough procurement (Chand 2019). \n3.6  Input Intensive to Knowledge Intensive Agriculture\nIndian agriculture is missing the state-of-the-art technology and ­modern method of \nfarming. Advanced countries are moving towards precision ­farming using sensors and \nother scientific tools for exact practices and application of inputs. It saves costs, reduces \n24\nRamesh Chand\nenvironmental effect and yields more and ­better-quality ­produce. We still continue to \nuse flood method of irrigation, broadcasting fertilisers and ­indiscriminately spraying \nchemicals, whereas ­advanced countries are shifting towards the use of sensor-based \napplication of inputs based on actual requirement of plants. ­Application of advanced \n­science at the farm level requires skill, knowledge, investment and ­improvement in \n­human capital in farming. Upgrading farming from low-tech to ­high-tech (green house \ncultivation, poly houses, tissue culture and precision farming) will reduce ­average cost, \nraise farmers’ income and address some scale ­disabilities. \nRecent years have seen a lot of interest among agri tech firms and ­several startups \nhave come in agriculture. They are infusing new innovations in a range of areas like \ndigital extension and solutions, arranging finance, agromet ­advisory, best ­practices, \nbetter crop management, disease and pest control, reading market pulses, price \n­prediction, fetching better price for output, and so on. So far, their impact is restricted \nto some pockets; but it shows great ­promise, and is expanding. \n3.7  Climate Change and Sustainability\nGreenhouse gases (GHG) emitted from agricultural activities are ­generally not \nvisible. The emission results from application of organic and inorganic ­inputs to the \nsoil, decomposition of biomass and dead plant residues, plant ­respiration, livestock \nrearing, enteric fermentation in ruminants, manure ­handling and burning of crop \nresidues. Agriculture is responsible for about 17% of GHG emission in India, which is \nalmost same as its share in the ­country’s GVA. This share will increase significantly \nif burning of crop residue, which is now spreading to all states, is taken into account. \nSimilarly, bulk of water used in the country is used in agriculture, and more than \n40% of the land area is put under agriculture. Thus, agriculture is quite significant for",

    "answer": "gricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\n3.8  Responsible Investment in Agriculture\nInvestment and subsidies are two important instruments for ­promoting growth in \nagriculture. Subsidies are needed in the initial phases of many ­economic ­activities to \npush adoption of new inputs, practices and technology. All major agriculture ­countries \nsubsidise agriculture to a varying extent. The broad guiding principle for subsidy in \ntoday’s context are: \n(i) \t should promote growth and efficiency. \n(ii) \t should avoid distorting input – output markets, \n(iii) \tshould not encourage uneconomic production, \n(iv) \t should not damage capacity of natural resource system and ­sustainability,\n(v) \t should not create serious inequity among social and economic classes and \nregions, and\n(vi) \t should not cause adverse effect on investments. \nThe biggest concern relating to subsidy is that they get entrenched and hurt fiscal \ndiscipline of the centre or the states.\nThe trend in subsidies and public investment in agriculture sector during the \n­previous two decades is presented in Table 9. The subsidy presented in Table 9 does \nnot include subsidy provided by the states and union territories (UTs) on power ­supply \nto agriculture, which is as high as all other subsidies for agriculture. It also does not \ninclude support to farmers under PM Kisan Nidhi amounting to Rs. 65,000 crore \n­(revised estimate), and most of the output price support and export subsidies. When \nall these are reckoned, the support to agriculture sector turns out to be much higher \nthan the subsidy figure presented in Table 9. Even when major support to agricul-\nture is not included in the subsidy data reported by National Accounts Statistics, the \n­reported level of subsidy is still 2.27 times the amount spent on infrastructure devel-\nopment in agriculture – that is so important for future growth of the sector. Public \ninvestment to GDP ratio in agriculture is as low as 2.2. Total investment in agriculture \nby all sources was 13.3% in year 2019-20.\nSector-wise shares in the total investment in agriculture show that 82% of it \ncomes from households (that is, farmers themselves), 17.49% from public ­sector and \n26\nRamesh Chand\nthe remaining (0.54%) from private corporate sector (Table 10). During 2019-20, the \ncorporate investment in agriculture sector accounted for a meagre percentage (0.11%) \nof the total  investment in the economy. \nRegulatory restrictions on marketing and absence of business-­friendly environ-\nment in agriculture act as a deterrent for corporate investment in ­agriculture produc-\ntion and marketing. This is said to be an important reason for the slow change in agri-\nculture, dominance of traditional marketing ­channels and the weak linkage between \npre and postharvest agriculture phases. \nA major chunk of the public investment in agriculture is spent on medium and \nmajor irrigation projects. However, these investments did not translate into creation \nTable 9: Public Investments and Subsidies in Agriculture and Allied Sector \n(At ­2011-12 Prices)\nYear\t\nAmount in Rs.

The Pradhan \nMantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, launched in 2015, aims at ­fixing the problem of poor \nperformance of medium and major irrigation projects and corrects the trend in area \nunder canal irrigation. This involves a paradigm shift in public investment in irriga-\ntion to close the gap between IPC and IPU, and targets early completion of the ongoing \nirrigation projects facing last mile ­connectivity problems. This change in approach to \npublic irrigation is expected to help in achieving the goal of ‘har khet ko pani’. \n3.9  Farmers’ Income\nTill recently, an increase in agri-food production remained primary focus of \n­agricultural policy and strategy. This strategy did not specifically target improvement \nin farmers’ income and supply of food to consumers at competitive price, which are \nimportant for welfare of farmers and consumers, respectively. \nAccelerated growth in some sectors of the Indian economy, following economic \nreforms in the early 1990s, lifted the overall growth rate of the economy from 4.2% \nduring the period between 1971 and 1991 to close to 7% after 1991. This helped in \n­doubling per capita income in the country at constant prices (2004-05) in just 17 \nyears as compared to the 37 years it took to double per capita income before 1991. \n­However, the agriculture sector, which comprised over 40% of the Indian economy \nand 59% of the workforce in 1991, did not experience any permanent change in its \ngrowth ­trajectory. The GVA of agriculture and allied sectors doubled in about 23 years \nbefore 1991, and it took same number of years to double again. Consequently, the \n­income of cultivators (farmers) has remained relatively low, and the gap with income \nof non-farm workers has enlarged. A cultivator (farmer) earns less than one-third of \nTable 10: Share of Various Sources in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in \nAgriculture and Total Economy at Current Prices, 2019-20\nSector\t\nGFCF \t\nAs % \t\nPercentage Share in Total GFCF of \n\t\n(Rs. 000 crore)\t\nof GVA\t\nPrivate \t\nPublic\t\nHouse\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCorporate\t\nSector\t\nholds\nAgriculture\t\n435\t\n12.8\t\n0.54\t\n17.49\t\n82.0\nNon-Agriculture\t\n5416\t\n35.9\t\n39.2\t\n24.6\t\n36.2\nTotal\t\n5851\t\n31.7\t\n36.3\t\n24.1\t\n39.6\nNote:\t\nGVA refers to gross value added.\nSource: \tNational Statistical Office (2021): National Accounts Statistics 2021, Ministry of \nStatistics and Programme Implementation, New Delhi.\n28\nRamesh Chand\nthe ­income of a non-farm worker (Chand 2019). This is major cause of rural distress. \nSpecial ­focus is needed to raise income of farmers at a faster rate. This requires trans-\nformation of agriculture production as well as marketing through a multi-pronged \nstrategy with due emphasis on enhancing productivity, reducing average cost, realis-\ning better price for farm produce, expanding allied activities and shifting farmers \nto non-farm ­occupations (Chand 2017). The three farm laws, enacted in year 2020, \nwhich have been repealed now because of opposition from some farmers groups, were \naimed to achieve this goal.\nBeside agriculture, income from non-farm sources constitutes an important part \nof income of farm households. According to the Situation Assessment of Agricultural \nHousehold 2019, on an average, an agricultural household earns 47.4% income from \nnon-agricultural economic activities (Table 11). This share was 40% during 2012-13. \nThis shows that non-agriculture income sources are becoming more important.   \nIt may be contended that agriculture households include a large number of agri-\ncultural labour households, who satisfies the definition of agricultural household and \ntheir wage earnings raise the share of non-agriculture income in the total household \nTable 11: Average Monthly Income (Rs.) from Different Sources Per Agricultural Household \nDuring July 2018-June 2019 for Each Size Class of Land Possessed (ha)\nSize Class  Farm Size\t\nTotal\t\nShare of Various Sources in Total Income (%) @\nof Land \t\nCategory\t\nIncome \t\nNet Receipt \t\nWages \t\nNet receipt \nPossessed \t \t\n(Rs.)\t\nfrom Crop and \t\n and\t\nfrom Non-farm \n(ha)\t\n\t\n\t\nLivestock\t\nSalaries\t\nbusiness\n<0.01\t\nBelow Sub-marginal\t 11204\t\n33.42\t\n57.43\t\n6.89\n0.01-0.40\t Sub-marginal\t\n7522\t\n28.44\t\n59.70\t\n9.35\n0.40-1.00\t Marginal\t\n8571\t\n46.88\t\n45.57\t\n6.65\n1.01-2.00\t\nSmall\t\n11449\t\n62.14\t\n31.85\t\n5.35\n2.01-4.00\t Semi-medium\t\n16435\t\n72.91\t\n21.59\t\n4.61\n4.01-10.00\t Medium\t\n28292\t\n81.63\t\n15.10\t\n1.67\n10.00+\t\nLarge\t\n60758\t\n90.64\t\n6.49\t\n1.91\nAll Sizes\t\n\t\n10218\t\n52.65\t\n39.76\t\n6.27\nNotes: \t * \tonly out-of-pocket expenses were considered for working out net receipt.\t\n\t\n@ Shares do not sum up to 100 as income from leasing out land is excluded. \t\n\t\n# Income from non-economic activities like pension, remittances, etc., are not included.\t\nSource: \tNational Statistical Office (2021b): Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households \nand Land Holdings in Rural India, 2019, Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation, New Delhi. \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n29\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nincome. The Situation Assessment Survey also ­provides detailed estimates of source-\nwise income by categories of land ­possessed (Table 11). The first category of below \nsub-marginal households (that is, those households possessing less than 0.01 hectare \nof land) may include households who are ­primarily labour households. The second \nand third categories sum up to marginal land holding and fourth category represents \nsmall farm size. ­Marginal farmers classified in the second and third sub categories \nof land possessed earned only 28% - 47% income from agriculture (crop and live-\nstock farming) and the ­remaining from salaries, wages and non-farm business. Small \n­farmers and semi-medium farm households earned 37.2% and 26.2% of their total \n­respective household income from non-agriculture sources. Furthermore, it is also \nobserved that not only is the share of non-agriculture sources in the total household \nincome substantial, but 68% of the farm households earned more income from non-\nagriculture sources than from crops and livestock ­production (that is, agriculture). \nTherefore, in order to increase income of farm households at a faster rate, both agri-\nculture as well as non-agriculture sources need to be tapped.\n3.10  Reforms in Policies and Regulations Affecting Agriculture\nThe package of economic reforms launched in the early 1990s did not cover poli-\ncies and regulations in the agriculture sector except some liberalisation of trade. The \neffect of these reforms is visible in the growth trend of agricultural output and non-\nagricultural output. The latter witnessed acceleration, whereas the former remained \nstuck at a 3% trend growth rate.\n3.10.1\t Reforms in Agricultural Policy and Market \nExcept a few states, agriculture marketing was brought under the state level APMC \nActs, also known as Agriculture Produce Market Regulation Act during the 1960s and \n1970s. These regulations helped in many ways. They checked rampant malpractices in \ntransactions of farm produce, upgraded mandis, ­improved competitiveness, brought \ntransparency in transactions through open auction of produce, and set up mechanism \nfor redressal of any grievance of seller farmers. \nOver time, it was felt that the system of agri marketing was not keeping pace with \nthe growth, and did not align with the needs of the agriculture sector and open new \nopportunities for trade. Some weaknesses also crept in the prevailing APMC system \nnecessitating change and improvement in regulations. Some of the states started us-\n30\nRamesh Chand\ning APMC mandis for revenue generation, which added to cost and price spread. Vari-\nous types of requirements in the form of ­licensing, registration and so on restricted \nparticipation in mandis to local traders, and closed the door for traders and buyers \nfrom outside the APMC. This raised the possibility of collusions, exploitation and \n­restrictive ­competition. Growth of APMC infrastructure fell far short of growth in \n­marketable s­urplus of crop output (Chand 2012). The net result has been that more \nproduce is ­transacted outside APMC mandis. Regulations also necessitated a large \nnumber of ­transactions between producers and consumers. This created a gap ­between \nthe prices paid by consumers and the prices received by producers, and ­denied direct \npurchase from farmers and direct supply by farmers to ­producers that has acquired \na lot of significance for high value crops and quality produce. The regulations worked \nagainst investment in ­agricultural marketing, ­infrastructure and ­logistics.\nThus, since long, there was a felt need to overcome the limitations and ­constraints \nof the present agricultural marketing system and to develop ­competitive, transparent \nand barrier free markets with the choices to the farmers to sell their produce in the \nmarkets and to the buyers offering a better price to them in a transparent manner. \nAround the year 2000, a debate started to bring reforms in agriculture, especially \nin agriculture marketing. Almost all experts and various high-level committees on \nagriculture constituted from time to time held the lack or poor progress of reforms \nin agriculture as a major constraint for high growth and the modernisation of \nagriculture. It was concluded that policy interventions at the national and state level \ndid not address structural problem of the agricultural sector, which is the basic reason \nfor various problems faced by the sector, farmers discontent and relatively low growth \nin farmers’ income. Ten important reasons for reforms in agriculture were discussed \nby Chand (2020). \nThe Government of India formulated and circulated model APMC Acts and Model \nContract Farming Acts for their adoption by the states. A large number of attempts \nwere made by successive governments to persuade the states to adopt marketing \n­reforms and reforms related to contract farming. Some of the states adopted model \nActs partially, but by and large their adoption remained partial, diluted, patchy and \nhalf hearted. Series of attempts were made by the government during 2017 to 2019 to \npersuade the states to adopt the model Acts to bring reforms in agriculture. However, \nimplementation of APMC and other reforms did not register any significant progress. \n31\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nWhen states did not come on board to reform their APMC Acts, despite repeated \npleas and persuasions by successive governments at the centre for 18 long years, the \noption left with the union government was either to ignore its responsibility to secure \nthe future of agriculture and farmers, or use the ­constitutional route for pan India \nreforms in agricultural policy and ­market. Moreover, ­COVID-19 threw up formidable \nchallenges to the economy, which could be addressed through bold and courageous \npolicy decisions with a ­potential of converting challenges into opportunity. Based on \nall these ­developments, the union government took a historical decision to take on \nitself the ­responsibility of bringing reforms in agriculture in 2020, and three new \nfarm acts were ­enacted after they were passed by the Parliament. These acts ­relate to \n(i) ­domestic ­agriculture trade, (ii) contract farming, and (iii) ­modification in ­Essential \nCommodities Act (1951). However, some ­misunderstanding and ­apprehensions \n­developed about the new farm laws amongst farmers of some of the states, and they \nwent on a long protest against the three new farm laws. Consequently, the three farm \nlaws have been repealed. Nevertheless, it is very clear that the ­sector cannot move \nforward on a healthy trend without reforms.\n3.10.2\t  MSP and Fair and Remunerative Prices \nSome farmers groups seek more support from the government for higher and \n­assured price of farm produce and the continuation of present regime of support \n­policies having direct and indirect effect on agriculture. This implies a status quo for \npower, fertiliser and water sectors. The demand for ­legalising MSP has gained consid-\nerable traction during the recent farmers’ agitation against the new farm laws. On the \nother hand, many experts contend that ­farmers’ ­aspirations from agriculture will not \nbe fulfilled without transformative ­changes in the sector. Nor can agriculture move to \nthe next stage of development without an enabling environment. Both of these goals \nrequire a reimagining of agriculture. It is really a tough situation to address these \n­issues without ­suitable changes in the regulatory environment.\nThere are three ways to enable farmers to get fair and remunerative prices: one, \nby creating an enabling environment for a fair, competitive and ­remunerative prices \nthrough market mechanism, two, by public intervention to keep prices ­remunerative \nthrough procurement or other means, and, three, by a combination of the above two. \nThe NDA government which came to power in 2014 followed the third route. It first \nchanged the norm for fixing MSP in 2018 to increase margin for ­producers to 50% \n32\nRamesh Chand\nor more over the average cost of crop ­production. ­Simultaneously, the government at \nthe centre circulated ­Model Acts ‘The ­Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing \n(Promotion and Facilitation) Act (2017)’ and ‘The ­Agricultural Produce & Livestock \n­Contract Farming and Services ­(Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018’ for adoption \nby the states. The third initiative taken by the government included two components \nof public intervention: (i) ­expansion in procurement of pulses and oilseeds by central \nagencies, and (ii) the states were given three options to keep farm prices at or above \nMSP. These were covered under the scheme PMASHA which ­include ­procurement \nunder (i) Price Support Scheme (PSS), (ii) Price Deficiency ­Payment (PDP), and (iii) \nPrivate Procurement and Stockists Scheme as a Pilot Scheme. \nStates were offered central assistance to procure up to 25% of the produce and to \nmeet up to 25% price deficiency under PDP scheme. The rationale ­behind the PSS was \nthat once 25% produce is purchased by public agencies, it will ­result in an increase in \nopen market prices to the level of MSP. This was same as the intervention in rice and \nwheat until a few years back. At the same time, attempts were made by the centre to \npersuade states to adopt ­model ­marketing act and Contract Farming Acts, but these \nattempts were met with lukewarm ­response from the states. The centre then brought \ncomprehensive reforms in agriculture through three farm laws to create a competitive \nmarket environment and other options like direct marketing and contract farming \nfor better price realisation by the farmers. But the new laws now stand repealed. The \nconcern now is how to ensure remunerative prices to farmers and to help them to get \nhigher incomes.\nSome farmers’ groups demand legalising of MSP as a solution to low market \n­prices. Suggestions are also made to adopt mechanism like PDP, if ­procurement at \nMSP is not feasible. Both these suggestions have far-reaching implications for the \neconomy, ­especially the fiscal health, private sector, crop ­pattern, ­diversification, \n­entrepreneurial skills of farmers and exports. Legal MSP ­cannot work if not supported \nby demand and supply side factors. At best, it can work only when trade pays a lower \nprice to farmers as compared to a competitive market price. But if MSP itself is above \nthe price dictated by demand and ­supply, then even competitive markets will not \n­support MSP. Thus, legal MSP can work if it is based on what would be open market \nprice or market clearance price. If MSP is anchored to a fixated formula of cost plus, \nwhich happens to be above the price supported by demand, then the private players \n33\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nwill not have any incentive to buy the produce. Price data shows that after adoption \nof the new formula for MSP in 2018, MSP remained higher than open market prices \nand international prices of most of the crops. In such a situation, neither will the \nprivate sector buy the produce, nor can the produce be exported without subsidising \nit. Thus, if we want to protect the farmers against unremunerative or uncompetitive \nprices through legal MSP, we should be guided by the price recommended by institu-\ntions like CACP ­considering the demand side factors and possible open market price. \n­Making MSP legal by itself will not ensure market prices moving to MSP. \nWhen private sector does not buy at legal MSP, all that is offered for sale will not be \npurchased and market clearance will not happen leading to a ­chaotic ­situation. Thus, \nthe government will be called to buy the produce. This amounts to taking over agricul-\nture trade by government, and has its own serious ­implications. Nowhere in the world, \nnot even in the socialist countries, this kind of mechanism is working. It should also \nbe kept in mind that non-MSP crops and products like fruits, vegetables, milk, egg and \nfish are showing a much higher growth rate than MSP crops in the ­country. A ­demand \n­driven ­production can be much more remunerative for farmers than ­production ­fixated \nto MSP.\nAnother suggestion to ensure legal MSP for farmers without distorting ­prices is to \npay the difference between legal MSP and market price received by ­farmers. A mecha-\nnism similar to this is followed in United States of America (USA) and China to pay the \nfarmers the difference between target or ­guaranteed price and actual ­market price. \nThe question is when USA and China are doing it, why India cannot do it? To under-\nstand this, the system prevailing in USA and China need to be understood ­clearly. \nChina has faced same situation which India is now facing in the case of surplus of rice \nand sugar, and changed policy support mechanism for agriculture from procurement \nand stocking to payment of price difference on a selective basis. \nAgricultural economists and experts need to debate the following issues to bring \nclarity to future policy for transformation of agriculture, price assurance and better \nfarm incomes:\n1. \t What is the best way to support farmers in raising their income?\n2. \t What are the learnings for India from the experience of other countries that \nprovide price support to their farmers?\n34\nRamesh Chand\n3. \t What are the implications of legalising MSP? What are other options to ­ensure \nremunerative prices to farmers?\n4. \t What should be the norm for MSP if it has to serve as a price guarantee?\n5. \t Should the responsibility for price assurance rest entirely with the ­centre? \nShould it be shared between the centre and the states? The ­China model can \nbe useful in this case.\n6. \t Should India move from price support and input subsidies to income support \nfor farmers? \nA scholarly and widespread debate is required on the above issues to steer clear \nthe policy roadmap for reimagining agriculture and its role in the future development \nof the country.\n4.  Conclusion\nA significant and sustained increase in farmers’ income and the transformation of \nagriculture require a paradigm shift in the entire approach ­towards ­agriculture ­sector. \nChanges in archaic regulations and liberalisation of the ­sector are a must for ­creating \nan enabling environment for a modern and ­vibrant agriculture. ­Advancement in \n­science led technology, an enhanced role of ­private sector in both pre and ­postharvest \nphases, liberalised output market, active land lease market and emphasis on ­efficiency \nwill equip agriculture to address the challenges of 21st century and contribute ­towards \nthe goal of a new India. A well-coordinated action and strategy between the ­centre \nand the states is needed to ensure that agriculture marches to the next stage of \n­development along with the other sectors. \nReferences\nBajar, S and U Mushtaq (2019): “The processes of Transformation”, in ­Inequality and \nthe Demand for Non-Farm Jobs, NIAS Report: NIAS/SSc/IHD/U/RR/15/2019, \nNational Institute of Advance Studies, Bengaluru, pp. 23-41.\nCentra Ground Water Board (2021): Dynamic Groundwater Resources of ­India 2020, \nMinistry of Jal Shakti, Government of India, New Delhi.\n35\nAgricultural Challenges and Policies for the 21st Century\nChand, R (2012): “Development Policies and Agricultural Markets”, Economic & \n­Political Weekly, Vol. 47, No. 52, pp. 53-63. \nChand, R (2014): From Slowdown to Fast Track: Indian Agriculture since 1995, \nWorking Paper 1/2014, National Centre for Agricultural ­Economics and Policy \nResearch, New Delhi.\nChand, R (2017): Doubling Farmers’ Income: Rationale, Strategy, Prospects and Ac-\ntion Plan, NITI Policy Paper No.1/2017, National Institution for Transforming \nIndia, New Delhi.\nChand, R (2019): “Innovative Policy Interventions for Transformation of ­Agriculture \nSector”, Agricultural Economics Research Review, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 1-10.\nChand, R (2020): New Farm Acts: Understanding the Implications, NITI Working \nPaper Series 1/2000, National Institution for Transforming ­India, New Delhi.\nChand, R and J Jumrani (2013): “Food Security and Undernourishment in ­India: \n­Assessment of Alternative Norms and the Income Effect”, Indian Journal of \nAgriculture Economics, Vol. 68, No. 1, pp. 39-53.\nChand, R and S Parappurathu (2012): “Temporal and Spatial Variations in ­Agricultural \nGrowth and Its Determinants”, Economic & Political Weekly, June 30, Vol. 47, \nNo. 26 & 27, pp.  55-64.\nChand, R and S Pavithra (2015): “Fertiliser Use and Imbalance in India ­Analysis of \nStates”, Economic & Political Weekly, October 31, Vol. 50, No. 44, pp. 98-104.\nChand, R, R Saxena and S Rana (2015): “Estimates and Analysis of Farm ­Income in \nIndia, 1983-84 to 2011-12”, Economic & Political Weekly, May 30, Vol. 50, No. \n22, pp. 139-145.\nChand, R, S K Srivastava and J Singh (2017): “Changes in Rural Economy of India, \n1971 to 2012: Lessons for Job-led Growth”, Economic & Political Weekly, \n­December 30, Vol. 53, No. 52, pp. 64-71. \nDirectorate of Economics and Statistics, Land Use Statistics, Ministry of ­Agriculture \nand Farmers Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi, Various Issues.  \n36\nRamesh Chand\nDirectorate of Economics and Statistics, Agricultural Statistics At A Glance, ­Ministry \nof Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi, ­Various \nIssues.  \nNational Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2019): Zero Budget Natural ­Farming – A \nMyth or Reality?

Indian \nagriculture continues to be the backbone of our society and it provides livelihood to \nnearly 50 per cent of our population. India is supporting 17.84 per cent of world’s \npopulation, 15% of livestock population with merely 2.4 per cent of world’s land and \n4 per cent water resources. Hence, continuous innovation and efforts towards \nproductivity, pre & post-harvest management, processing and value-addition, use of \ntechnology and infrastructure creation is an imperative for Indian agriculture. Various \nstudies on fresh fruits and vegetables, fisheries in India have indicated a loss \npercentage ranging from about 8% to 18% on account of poor post-harvest \nmanagement, absence of cold chain and processing facilities. Therefore, agro \nprocessing and agricultural exports are a key area and it is a matter of satisfaction \nthat India’s role in global export of agricultural products is steadily increasing. India is \ncurrently ranked tenth amongst the major exporters globally as per WTO trade data \nfor 2016.  India’s share in global exports of agriculture products has increased from \n1% a few years ago, to 2.2 % in 2016. \n \nRecent growth rates show that agri-food production is rising faster than growth in \ndomestic demand, and volume of surplus for export is witnessing accelerated growth. \nThis offers scope and opportunity for capturing overseas markets to earn foreign \nexchange and enable producers to earn higher prices for farm produce. \n \n2. Agriculture Export Policy: Objective and Vision \n \nA dynamic nation of 1.3 billion consumers with rising discretionary incomes, changing \nfood patterns, vast farming area, diverse agriculture and a large population dependent \non agriculture has propelled India to the world’s center stage as a big consumer \nmarket and also as a key supplier of food products.  It has often been suggested that \nan essential element of “Make in India” has to be “Bake in India”, i.e. a renewed focus \non value addition and on processed agricultural products. The rapidly growing global \npopulation and shrinking farmlands, coupled with changing socio-economic, agro-\nclimatic and dietary patterns, have challenged scientists and policymakers to \nreconsider how we grow and feed 7.5 billion global citizens. India’s quest, then, is to \ngrow sustainably, trade abundantly and progress harmoniously. Agriculture export, if \nproperly supported by infrastructure, institutional back up, packaging, freight \ntransport and connected to the internal production system backed by market access \nwill be in a position to transform the agricultural economy. \n \nChallenges, however, are aplenty; from low farm productivity to poor infrastructure to \nglobal price volatility to market access. The vision of Prime Minister Shri Narendra \nModi to double farmer’s income by 2022 would require a series of interventions to \nimprove production and productivity, better price realization for farm produce, along \nwith economizing the cost of production.  There has been a long felt need for a \ndedicated agricultural export policy in India.  \n \nPage 7 of 31 \n \n \nThe need for a dedicated policy under Department of Commerce (DoC) overarching \numbrella arises due to the federal and administrative structure of the Union and State \ngovernment. While the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer Welfare \n(DAC&FW) and Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DAHDF) \nfocus on production, pre-harvest and boosting farmer income, the Ministry of Food \nProcessing Industries (MoFPI) focuses on value addition, post-harvest losses and \nemployment generation. The DoC, on the other hand, is focused on foreign trade \nacross sectors. There is an increasing need for the Government of India to establish a \nstable and predictable Agriculture Export Policy which aims at reinvigorating the entire \nvalue chain from export oriented farm production and processing to transportation, \ninfrastructure and market access. The Agriculture Export Policy has to be dovetailed \nwith existing framework for agriculture and surplus agricultural produce. There is a \nsymbiotic relationship between a framework for sustainable agriculture on the one \nhand and a viable Agriculture Export Policy on the other. There is a need to craft a \npolicy that will deliver incomes into the pockets of farmer through crucial export \nopportunities. \n \nThe Agriculture Export Policy is framed with a focus on agriculture export oriented \nproduction, export promotion, better farmer realization and synchronization within \npolicies and programmes of Government of India. It is required to have a “Farmers’ \nCentric Approach” for improved income through value addition at source itself which \nwill help to minimize losses across the value chain.   India needs to have farmer \noriented strategy to achieve the twin objective of food security and a prominent \nagriculture exporter of the world. The policy will also give a big push to food \nprocessing/manufacturing to have much higher growth in food production which will \nincrease India’s share of value added processed products in its Agriculture export \nbasket at the global level. The broad objectives and vision is highlighted below.  \n \nINDIA’S AGRICULTURE EXPORT POLICY- OBJECTIVES \n \n• \nTo double agricultural exports from present ~US$ 30+ Billion to ~US$ 60+ \nBillion by 2022 and reach US$ 100 Billion in the next few years thereafter, with \na stable trade policy regime. \n• \nTo diversify our export basket, destinations and boost high value and value \nadded agricultural exports including focus on perishables.  \n• \nTo promote novel, indigenous, organic, ethnic, traditional and non-traditional \nAgri products exports. \n• \nTo provide an institutional mechanism for pursuing market access, tackling \nbarriers and deal with sanitary and phytosanitary issues. \n• \nTo strive to double India’s share in world agri exports by integrating with global \nvalue chain at the earliest. \n• \nEnable farmers to get benefit of export opportunities in overseas market. \n \nINDIA’S AGRICULTURE EXPORT POLICY-VISION \n \n \nHarness export potential of Indian agriculture, through suitable policy instruments, to \nmake India global power in agriculture and raise farmers income.  \n \nPage 8 of 31 \n \n \n3. Current Agri Trade Scenario \nWorld agricultural trade has been relatively stagnant in the last five years (2013-2017) \ndue mainly to fall in global prices. The sharp drop in oil prices was a major contributor \nto softening of global agricultural commodity prices. However, volume of trade did not \ndecline which show strong demand in global market. Due to effect of fall in global \nprices and back to back to drought during 2014-15 and 2015-16  India’s agricultural \nexport 1 dropped by -5% CAGR from US$ 36 Billion in FY13 to US$ 31 Billion in FY172. \nHowever, with normal production in year 2016-17 India’s agri exports have recovered \nsignificantly despite tight global market situation. A comparative analysis of India’s ten \nyear agri exports reveals an encouraging picture. Indian agricultural exports grew at \n9% compared to China (8%), Brazil (5.4%) and US (5.1%) between 2007 and 2016. \nDuring this period, exports of coffee, cereals, horticultural produce doubled; while \nexports of meat, fish, processed products grew between three to five times. Despite \nthis, India’s agri exports are lower than countries like Thailand and Indonesia with \nmuch smaller agricultural land. \n \nIndian agriculture today is structurally different than what it was during the Green \nRevolution era.  Between the early-1970s and the late-nineties, India’s annual farm \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded from about US$25 billion to over US$100 \nbillion.  During this initial period, the growth was sluggish and it was largely cereals-\ncentric, limited to wheat and rice. However, between 2000 and 2014, the country’s \nagricultural production has surged from US$101 billion to about US$367 billion, driven \nmainly by high-value segments such as horticulture, dairy, poultry and inland aqua-\nculture.  No other country has a more diverse food and non-food agriculture base as \nIndia and this generates the optimism that India can be a leading player in the world \nagricultural trade.   \n \nIndia’s export basket is a diversified mix led by rice (US$ 6 Bn), marine products (US$ \n5.8 Bn), and meat (US$ 4 Bn) which together constitute ~52% of its total agri \nexports3. While India occupies a leading position in global trade of aforementioned \nagri products, its total agri export basket accounts for little over 2% of world agri \ntrade, estimated at US$ 1.37 Trillion4. An important reason for this apparently inward \nlooking policies of India are largely aimed at food security and price stabilization.  \n \nIndia has remained at the lower end of the global agri export value chain given that \nmajority of its exports are low value, raw or semi-processed and marketed in bulk. \nThe share of India’s high value and value added agri produce5 in its agri export basket \nis less than 15% compared to 25% in US and 49% in China6. India is unable to export \nits vast horticultural produce due to lack of uniformity in quality, standardization and \nits inability to curtail losses across the value chain. Given the globalization of value \n                                                           \n1 HS Code Chapters 1-23 \n2 Source: DGCIS \n3Data pertains to 2016-17, Source: DGCIS \n4 Source: ITC (Chapter 1-23) \n5 HS Code Chapters 7,8,16,20,21 \n6Source: ITC \n \nPage 9 of 31 \n \nchains, it is imperative that the country make concerted efforts to boost exports of \nhigh margin, value added and branded processed products. The policy will involve a \nparadigm shift from residual export after meeting domestic demand to targeted export \naccording to preferences of overseas market.    \n  \nTop exportable agricultural commodities and products would be identified on the basis \nof current global and Indian trade. Each commodity would be studied in detail based \non five key criteria: global trade, five-year impact potential, India’s current \ncompetitiveness, scope for value addition and future market potential. About ten \ncommodities would be shortlisted as focus commodities for specific farm, \ninfrastructure and market intervention.  \n \nPreliminary analysis shows very high potential for: Shrimps, Meat, Basmati & non-\nBasmati Rice, Grapes, Bananas, Pomegranate, vegetables including Potatoes, \nProcessed / Value added products, Cashew, Plant parts/medicinal herbs in value added \nforms including herbal medicines, food based nutraceuticals, aromatics, spices (cumin, \nturmeric, pepper), Ethnic & Organic Food. \n \n4. Elements of the Agriculture Export Policy Framework \nThe policy recommendations in this report are organized in two broad categories: \nstrategic and operational. The salient features of the agricultural export policy are \nhighlighted below and discussed in greater detail in subsequent sub-sections.  \n \nStrategic \n \nPolicy Measures  \nInfrastructure and Logistics Support  \nHolistic Approach  to boost exports  \nGreater involvement of State Governments in Agri Exports  \n \nOperational \nFocus on Clusters  \nPromoting Value added exports  \nMarketing and promotion of “Brand India”  \nAttract private investments into production and processing \nEstablishment of Strong Quality Regimen  \nResearch & Development  \nMiscellaneous  \n \n5. Strategic Recommendations \n5.1 Policy Measures: Discussions with public and private stakeholders across the \nagricultural value chain highlighted certain structural changes that were required to \nboost agricultural exports. These comprise of both general and commodity specific \nmeasures that may be urgently taken and at little to no financial cost. The subsequent \ngains, however, are aplenty.  \n \n5.1.A. Stable Trade Policy Regime: Given the domestic price and production \nvolatility of certain agricultural commodities, there has been a tendency to utilize trade \n \nPage 10 of 31 \n \npolicy as an instrument to attain short term goals of taming inflation. Such \ncircumstantial measures are often product and sector specific, for instance, the ad-\nhoc ban or imposition of Minimum Export Price (MEP) for onion and non-Basmati rice \nexports. This breaks export supply chains and affects India’s image as a reliable \nsuppliers affecting price realization for Indian produce.  The country is seen as a \nsource of high quality agricultural products and changes in export regime on ground \nof domestic price fluctuations, religious and cultural belief can have long term \nrepercussions.  \n \nSuch measures require constant fine tuning and keeps the market anxious which often \nleads to price shocks. While these decisions may serve the immediate purpose of \nmaintaining domestic price stability, they end up distorting India’s image in \ninternational trade as a long term and reliable supplier. It is imperative to frame a \nstable and predictable policy with limited State interference to send a positive signal \nto the international market. It is necessary to refrain from making a distinction \nbetween the products meant for export and those for domestic consumption. One way \nto do this is to decide that export restrictions/bans would be resorted to only in the \nrarest circumstances. This alone will provide the farmer some confidence to plan for \nthe overseas market. Policy measures should assure farmers to respond to market \nsignals with confidence and redirect resources towards products that will earn higher \nreturns.   \n \nThe Agri Export Policy thus aims at:  \n \n1) Providing assurance that the processed agricultural products and all kinds of organic \nproducts will not be brought under the ambit of any kind of export restriction (viz. \nMinimum Export Price, Export duty, Export bans, Export quota, Export capping, Export \npermit etc.)   even though the primary agricultural product or non-organic agricultural \nproduct is brought under some kind of export restrictions. \n2)  Identification of a few commodities which are essential for food security in \nconsultation with the relevant stakeholders and Ministries.  Any export restriction on \nsuch identified commodities under extreme price situation will be based on decision \nof a high level committee. Also, any kind of export prohibitions and restrictions on the \nidentified commodities above would be taken up in a WTO compatible manner. \n3). Liberalised import of agricultural products for value addition and re-export.  \n \n5.1.B. Reforms in APMC Act and streamlining of mandi fee: Agricultural \nProduce Marketing Committees (APMC) Acts across States have not been able to \nachieve the farmers’ welfare envisaged in these Acts. Some APMC market yards or \nmandis which have bred inefficiency and cartelization are a classic case in point. Since \ndecades farmers have been under compulsion to sell their produce in official market \nyards which may or may not offer the best remunerative prices. Monopoly of the APMC \nprevents private players from setting up markets and investing in market \ninfrastructure. \n \nThe market fee, arthiya commission and other charges left outside the Goods and \nServices Tax (GST) remain under the purview of the state (and local bodies). Different \nStates continue to charge different fees on mandi procurement (Basmati rice – Punjab \n \nPage 11 of 31 \n \n4%, Haryana 4%, Delhi- 1%; Pulses – Maharashtra 1%, UP 2.5%; Soya de-oiled cake \n- Maharashtra 0.85%, Madhya Pradesh 2.2%). \n \nSome states have adopted the Model APMC act and made amendments to de-notify \nfruits and vegetables. Establishment of Electronic National Agriculture Market (E-NAM) \nis a step in the right direction. Quality measurement, infrastructure and dispute \nsettlement mechanism would add more power to E-NAM. The Finance Minister, while \npresenting the Budget for 2018-19 has made the announcement of 22,000 Gramin \nRural Markets which will allow the flexibility to the farmers to sell their produce without \nbeing subjected to regulations constraining decision to buy and sell. \n \nThe Agriculture Export Policy aims at using the Directorate General of Foreign Trade \n(DGFT) field offices, Export Promotion Councils, Commodity Boards and Industry \nAssociations to act as advocacy forum for reform by all the states. Efforts will continue \nwith State Governments to remove perishables from their APMC Act. State \nGovernments would also be urged to standardize/ rationalize mandi taxes for largely \nexported agricultural products. Simplification or uniformity of mandi/agricultural fee \nacross States will create a transparent supply chain that will empower the farmer, \nprovide him wider access to markets and enable free trade across the country. \n \n5.2 Infrastructure and logistics \n \nPresence of robust infrastructure is critical component of a strong agricultural value \nchain. This involves pre-harvest and post-harvest handling facilities, storage & \ndistribution, processing facilities, roads and world class exit point infrastructure at \nports facilitating swift trade. Mega Food Parks, state-of-the-art testing laboratories \nand Integrated Cold Chains are the fundamentals on which India can increase its \nagricultural exports. Given the perishable nature and stringent import standards for \nmost of the food products, efficient and time-sensitive handling is extremely vital to \nagricultural commodities. \n \nA comprehensive need-gap analysis of existing export oriented infrastructure across \nthe value chain will be undertaken. Ports are a vehicle for economic development. Yet, \nwhile port development will indeed improve exports it will not provide an exceptional \nboost to agri trade until supply, quality, handling and hinterland connectivity is \nenhanced.  Identifying strategically important clusters, creating inland transportation \nlinks alongside dedicated agri infrastructure at ports with 24x7 customs clearance for \nperishables will therefore go a long way in boosting trade exponentially. The focus \ntherefore shall be to: \n \n \nIdentify major ports where current/projected bulk and container agri traffic \ndemands infrastructure and modernization initiatives. \n \nSea Port - development of dedicated perishable berths, agricultural jetties; \n \nRailway -infrastructure at stations to handle agri products, Reefer Wagons; \n \nAirport -Identify the challenges of operationalizing existing defunct infrastructure \nat ports such as the Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) and requirement of new \nCPCs, loaders, designated and sufficient quarantine areas, better Hinterland \nConnectivity. \n \nPage 12 of 31 \n \n \nIt is often pointed out that expenses towards logistics handling is about 14 to 15% of \nthe cost of exports. Benchmarked against 8 to 9% in some of the developed \neconomies, the savings on account of improved logistics can make Indian agricultural \nexports significantly competitive in the global market place. It will be the endeavour \nof Agriculture Export Policy to compile the logistic bottlenecks confronting different \nproducts and work with the newly created Logistic Division in the DoC, different Line \nMinistries and State Governments for addressing the issues identified and removal of \nsuch bottlenecks. \n \n5.3 Holistic approach to boost exports \nAgricultural exports are determined by supply side factors, food security, processing \nfacilities, infrastructure bottlenecks and several regulations. This involves multiple \nministries including DAC&FW, DAHDF, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India \n(FSSAI), Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) / Indian Council \nof Agricultural Research (ICAR), MoFPI, Ministry of Shipping & Transport, Ministry of \nRailways, Ministry of Civil Aviation Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA), \nDepartment of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD). Over and above this, many of the \ninfrastructure issues handled by State Governments also crucially impinge on \nagricultural exports. \n \nAgricultural export policy will involve important organizations related to agricultural \nproduction to make special efforts towards promotion of export. Krishi Vigyan Kendras \nwill be involved to take export oriented technology to farmers and create awareness \namong farmers about export prospects.   \n \nThe stakeholders have often talked of a disjointed, single-minded mandates of \nrespective ministries which restrict their ability to successfully influence domestic \nagricultural production and global trade. International trade opportunities play \nsignificant role in the cropping and farming decisions of domestic farmers; guar, rice, \npulses and oilseeds are excellent examples. Equally, the agricultural production \nsituation of the country influence a country’s agricultural and food imports and \nexports. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) / United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary \nSurveillance (FSVPS) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in USA, Russia & EU \nrespectively are often cited as excellent examples of exclusive organizations which are \nempowered to frame, regulate and implement policies related to both agricultural \nproduction and trade. It may be worthwhile to work towards similar agencies in India \nwhich cover all aspects of agri-food production and trade in a effective and calibrated \nmanner. \n \nPesticide and chemical residues are a chief cause of concern for Indian agricultural \nexports. Indian food exports are sometimes rejected due to residues found that are \nhigher than Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of importing nations. From Basmati to \ngrapes to peanut - the list is long. Lack of awareness amongst Indian farmers \nregarding the judicious and timely use of chemicals has been a major impediment. To \nadd to this, farmers may be using   many pesticides which are not permitted or are \n \nPage 13 of 31 \n \nincreasingly being banned in other nations. EU’s recent move to drastically reduce the \nMRL of Tricyclazole from 1 PPM to 0.01 PPM in Basmati rice is a case in point. \nConsidered to be highly cost effective and farmer friendly, Tricyclazole has been in \nwidespread use across India. If Indian rice exporters were to implement a farmer \nawareness and agri input switch program, it would best be done in conjunction with \nDACFW and DoC. Furthermore, since agriculture and land are State subjects this would \nrequire State Governments to be fully on board. Quality control can best happen at \nfarm level - going forward, it is plain that strategic and operational synergy across \nministries will be key to boosting productivity and quality. \n \nWhole of government approach will address issues of (a) R & D for improved varieties, \nvalue addition and packaging, (b) Establishment of a good standards regimen, (c)  A \nholistic response to Sanitary and PhytoSanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade \n(TBT) barriers faced by Indian products, (d) Identification of winning sectors and \nstrategies for augmenting exports in those sectors. These issues are elaborated further \nin the operational part of the strategies. \n \n5.4 Greater involvement of State Governments in Agriculture Exports \nSince 1919, when the Montford Reforms declared it a ‘Provincial’ subject, agriculture \nin India has enjoyed the distinction of being a State subject and after independence, \nwhen the constitution was drafted it became a “State” subject. While the central \ngovernment may advise and allocate funds, proper implementation of farm and market \ninfrastructure reforms lies at the behest of State Governments.  \n \nEach State invariably has its own set of priorities, socio-economic & political realities \nand agricultural nuances which they strive to align with the nation’s overarching goals. \nIndeed, every State has a different (and often multiple) agro-climatic zone leading to \ndifferent cropping patterns and they each suffer from vagaries of nature in extremes; \none part of India may experience a drought while another may be dealing with floods. \nFurthermore, “trade and commerce” are in the Union list and States often see no \nformal role for themselves in the nation’s agricultural exports.  \n \nSome of the suggestions which have come for facilitating agriculture exports at the \nState level are as follows: \n \n5.4.A. Identification of a nodal State Department / Agency for promotion of \nagriculture export: In many States, either the Industry Department, Micro, Small & \nMedium Enterprises (MSME) Department or Commerce and Industry Department are \nidentified as the nodal department for export promotion and consequently focus is lost \nwith regard to agricultural exports.  Depending on the export potential of the State \nand the quality of resources available with autonomous bodies, either a Department \nor an Agency of the State Govt. could be declared as a nodal body for agricultural \nexports. For example, in Maharashtra, the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing \nBoard, in Karnataka, the Karnataka State Agricultural Produce Processing and Export \nCorporation Limited, in Gujarat, the Gujarat State Agriculture Marketing Board etc. \nplay a pro-active role in facilitating exports and such organizations could be recognized \nas the nodal body for agriculture export promotion. The function of such nodal agency \n \nPage 14 of 31 \n \nwould be to remain engaged with the stakeholders, identify infrastructure and logistic \nbottlenecks, liaise with different Departments within the State Government to address \nissues faced by the exporters,  identification of the schemes run by various Central \nMinistries and Agencies and maximize the allocation for the State Governments, \norganize reverse buyer-seller meet at the State level by getting buyers from abroad, \nencouraging State level exporters to participate in the relevant international fairs, etc. \nThey would also work towards creation of dynamic and functional information-sharing \nmechanism between the State and Centre on SPS and TBT issues. The DoC will play \na proactive role in capacity building, supporting and handholding such nodal agency \nat the State level. \n \n5.4.B. Inclusion of agricultural exports in the State Export Policy: Many State \nGovernments have come up with an export policy and special focus could be made on \nagri exports.  Pushing for policy changes in the APMC Act, bringing out policy for cage \nculture for inland and marine fisheries, promoting Good Agricultural Practices \n(GAP)/IndGAP, working on quality assurance system, planning for pre and post- \nharvest infrastructure creation for further value addition, incentivizing value addition \nand food processing industries, etc. could be included as part of the State’s Export \nPolicy.  \nAn approach of developing product specific clusters in different agro climatic zones of \nthe country would help in dealing with various supply side issues viz., soil nutrients \nmanagement, higher productivity, adoption of market oriented variety of crop, use of \ngood agriculture practices, etc. Integration of processors / exporters with farmers will \nensure better returns and stable market. The State Governments may identify such \nclusters which have a high potential of export and work with related agencies for \nfacilitating export from those clusters. \n \n5.4.C. Infrastructure and logistics to facilitate agricultural exports: An \nassessment of the State’s potential in key agricultural sectors and drawing up an action \nplan to support the infrastructure creation will be crucial to promoting exports.  For \ne.g., in the coastal states, creation of state of the art fish landing centres, high quality \nfishing harbour, pre-processing facilities etc. are extremely crucial.  Similarly, creating \na series of cold chain facilities for perishables, creating vapour heat treatment and \nirradiation facilities to enable export to specific markets etc. are some of the \ninterventions which need to be initiated by the State Governments. Issues wr.t. \nLogistics need urgent attention e.g. many air cargo companies are yet to achieve their \nfullest potential due to non-availability of landing schedules in most of the leading \nIndian airports which handle air cargo. Similarly lowering landing fee / parking fee & \nless duty on ATF Fuel would make it cost affective for export of fresh / highly \nperishable / processed agricultural products. A concerted effort needs to be taken up \nby respective State Governments to identify the infrastructure bottlenecks, issues \nrelating to logistics and then identify sectors which are amenable to private \ninvestment/FDI and sectors where Government has to invest.  ICD/CFS with good \nrevenue models could be thought of in the private sector whereas cold chain logistics, \nwarehouse, rail and road infrastructure, etc. would require public funding.  A clear \naction plan on the infrastructure gap would enable State and Central Government to \nidentify resources for such infrastructure. \n \nPage 15 of 31 \n \nThe Government has made an effort to supply uninterrupted, quality and affordable \npower to the agriculture sector. Various measures viz. Agriculture Demand Side \nManagement Scheme (AgDSM), Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, Power for \nAll and Cold Storage Industries, KUSUM Harnessing Solar Power for Rural India \nScheme have helped improve the situation. The favourable power situation in the \ncountry could be utilized for supporting the infrastructure required to facilitate \nagricultural exports. \n \n5.4.D.  Institutional Mechanism at Union level, State level and cluster level \nto support exports: The agriculture export policy will examine the models by \ndifferent States and suggest some of the best practices in coordinating between \ndifferent Departments concerned with export of agricultural products. Departments \nlike Agriculture, Horticulture, Fisheries, Food Processing, and Commerce& Industry \netc. look after the production and post-handling issues relating to agriculture, \nhorticulture, aquaculture, tea, coffee, spices and value addition of these products at \nthe State level.  In some States, committees chaired either by the Chief Secretary or \nAgriculture Production Commissioner has been doing an effective job in coordinating \nwith different Departments and with DGFT, Customs, and autonomous bodies under \nDepartment of Commerce for facilitating export promotion measures. \n \nThe State level export monitoring committee chaired by the Chief Secretary and \nsupported by the Regional Authorities of DGFT, autonomous bodies under Department \nof Commerce - Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development \nAuthority (APEDA), Marine Products Exports Development Authority (MPEDA), Export \nInspection Council (EIC), Spices Board, Coffee Board, Tea Board, Rubber Board, \nTobacco Board, different Export Promotion Councils (EPC), Customs, Plant / animal",

    "question": "uarantine could provide the institutional mechanism for this purpose at the State \nlevel. \n \nSimilarly, an institutional mechanism at the Central Government level is envisaged to \nmonitor the progress made in implementation of the Agriculture Export Policy. A \ncommittee headed by Commerce Secretary and with participation of Secretaries of \nDAC&FW, DAHDF, DARE / ICAR, DoCA, DFPD, MoFPI, FSSAI, DGFT, Customs and \nrepresentatives of concerned State Governments to meet on a quarterly basis would \nfacilitate convergence of efforts /schemes, suggest actions to be taken for achieving \nthe objectives of policy. A monitoring cell is to be established in DoC to follow up on \ndeliverables by all the concerned Departments, Organisations and State Government.",
    "answer": "ctionable steps with proper identification of roles and responsibility would be set by \nthe monitoring cell. \n \nFor monitoring the cluster development work, a cluster facilitation framework to be \nled by the Cluster facilitation cell under Nodal Collector / Director (Agriculture) / \n(Horticulture) / (Fisheries) is also proposed. The exporters, potential exporters, \nfarmers’ producers companies, producers’ cooperative, Panchayat / DAY-NRLM etc. \nare important stakeholders in the cluster level committee. Quarterly meeting at the \nlevel of Nodal Collector / Director by involving the above mentioned stakeholders and \nthe relevant Departments would enable the clusters to increase productivity, increase \narea under cultivation of the exportable item and improve quality of produce. The \n \nPage 16 of 31 \n \nlinking of farmers’ producers’ organizations, farmers’ cooperatives to the export value \nchain will be initiated through creation of infrastructure, facilitating primary and \nsecondary processing in the clusters and also by linking them to the exporters.  \n \nIn addition, the following interventions are also taken up at the State level in some \nStates.  \n \n(a) Encourage the industry bodies/associations to play a more pro-active role \nThe various bodies representing different food processing sectors need to be more \npro-active in giving suggestions on accessing new markets and consolidating in \nexisting markets. \n(b) Greater involvement of industry in R&D \nThere is a need to ensure greater interaction between the various research \norganizations and industry bodies which will enable the research bodies to work on \nindustry specific requirements. \n   \n6. Operational Recommendations \n6.1 Focus on Clusters \nWhile presenting the budget for 2018-19, the Finance Minister emphasized the need \nfor focusing on a cluster development approach to boost the agricultural and \nhorticultural production in India. A similar approach in export centric clusters is likely \nto result in a more focused pre and post-harvest management of the production as \nwell as in upgrading the supply chain to attain much higher levels of export from those \nclusters. \n \nThere is a need to evolve and put in place institutional mechanism for effective \ninvolvement and engagement of small and medium farmers for entire value chain as \ngroup enterprise(s) within cluster of villages at the block level for select produce(s). \nThis will help to realize actual benefit and empowerment of farming community to \ndouble their income through entire value chain. \n \nExporting horticultural products requires significant volumes of high quality produce \nof the same variety with standard parameters matching import demands. Small \nlandholding pattern and low farmer awareness in India has often meant limited \nvolumes of different varieties of multiple crops with little or no standardization. Export \noriented cluster development across States will be key to ensuring surplus produce \nwith standard physical and quality parameters which meet export demands. The \nsuccess of such a scheme will depend on State Government infrastructure. It is \ntherefore critical that the Government of India encourage and incentivize the State \nGovernments by strengthening State infrastructure to:  \n \n \nIdentify suitable production clusters \n \nConduct farmer registrations \n \nDigitization of land records \n \nPromote Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO) \n \nPage 17 of 31 \n \n \nDomestic factors play vital role in export which include technology, trade facilitation, \ninfrastructure, logistics, regulation, institutions, competitive markets and participation \nof private trade in all stages of supply chain including pre-harvest. It is recommended \nthat this scheme should involve active partnership with private exporters who will have \na natural incentive to promote such clusters. It is expected that greater involvement \nof private sector in agriculture exports would bring focus, better coordination and \nexport oriented production.  \n \nFarm Producer Organizations are an institutional innovation to help small holders \novercome scale disadvantages and extend their reach to modern technology and \ndistant markets. New AEP will address policy obstacles faced by FPOs and work \nthrough NABARD, SFAC and State level organizations to expand FPO network. \n \nSubject to successful implementation of these clusters, a transition to Agri Export \nZones (AEZs) could be thought of to facilitate value addition, common facility creation \nand higher exports from such zones. The measures towards setting up and functioning \nof the AEZs would be taken up in WTO compatible manner. Special Economic Zones \n(SEZ) facilitate production of goods at a comparatively lower price for exporters aiming \nto be globally competitive. India has many successful SEZs established in Public and \nPrivate sectors in specific sectors like IT, Textiles, Pharmaceutical and some being \nmulti sectoral. There are opportunities for developing Agriculture Export SEZ mainly \naimed at producing value added agriculture commodities for certain countries which \nare largely dependent on import of agriculture products. The interest of some \ncountries (having substantial gap in domestic availability of grains, vegetables and \nfruits) can be explored for bringing in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Agriculture \nExport SEZ in order to ensure food security of that country. There can be complete \nbuyback arrangements by the countries which are bringing in FDI thus providing a \nstable market for Indian exports. \n \nStakeholders have recommended for creation of a corpus for export oriented \nproduction through development of clusters. This will be the key to boosting volumes \nof standardized, good quality exports.  \n \nAs part of the Agriculture Export Policy, following unique product-district clusters have \nbeen identified for export promotion. A Product / cluster is identified based on the \nexisting production contributing to exports, exporters operations, scalability of \noperations, size of export market / India’s share, awareness about SPS requirements,  \nand potential for increase in export in short term. The list of clusters provided below \nis tentative and could be expanded, provided the conditions for formation of cluster \nare met.  \n \nProduct \nRegion \nState \nDistrict \nBanana \n \nSouth \nKerala \nThrissur, Wayanad, \nThiruvananthapuram \nAndhra \nPradesh \nKadapa, Anantapur \nTamil Nadu \nTrichy, Theni, Pollachi \n \nPage 18 of 31 \n \nProduct \nRegion \nState \nDistrict \nWest \nMaharashtra \nJalgaon, Kolhapur, Solapur \nGujarat \nBharuch, Narmada, Surat \nPomegranate \nSouth \nAndhra \nPradesh \nAnantapur, Kurnool \nKarnataka \nBelgaum, Mysore \nWest \nMaharashtra \nSolapur, Ahmednagar, Pune \nCentral \nMadhya \nPradesh \nKhargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur \nMango \nWest \nMaharashtra \nRatnagiri, Sindhudurg \nGujarat \nJunagarh, Valsad, Kutch, Navsari \nNorth \nUttar Pradesh \nSaharanpur, Meerut, Lucknow \nSouth \nTelangana \nRangareddy, Mehboobnagar, \nWarangal \nAndhra \nPradesh \nKrishna, Chittoor, Kurnool \nGrapes \nWest \nMaharashtra \nPune, Nasik, Sangli \nRose Onion \nSouth \nKarnataka \nBangalore Rural, Chikkaballapura \nOnion \nWest \nMaharashtra \nNasik \nCentral \nMadhya \nPradesh \nIndore, Sagar, Damoh \nPotato \nNorth \nUttar Pradesh \nAgra, Farukkabad \nPunjab \nJalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, \nNavashehar \nWest \nGujarat \nBanaskantha, SabarKantha \nCentral \nMadhya \nPradesh \nIndore, Gwalior \nTea \nEast \nAssam \nTinsukia, Sibsagar, Dibrugarh \nCoffee \nSouth \nKarnataka \nChikkamagaluru, Kodagu, Hassan \nMarine \nproducts \nSouth \nAndhra \nPradesh \nEast Godavari, Vishakapatnam, West \nGodavari, Nellore \nEast \nOdisha \nJagatsinghpur, Bhadrak, Balasore \nWest \nGujarat \nKutch, Veraval, Navasari, Valsad \nChilli \nSouth \nTelangana \nKhammam, Warangal \nAndhra \nPradesh \nGuntur \n \nTurmeric \nSouth \nTelangana \nNizamabad, Karimnagar \nKerala \nWayanad, Alleppy \nEast \nEast \nMeghalaya \nWest Jaintia Hills \nOdisha \nKandhamal \nCumin \nWest \nGujarat \nBanaskantha, Mehsana \nNorth \nRajasthan \nJalore, Jodhpur, Barmer, Nagaur, Pali \nPepper \nSouth \nSouth \nKerala \nWayanad \nKarnataka \nChikmagalur \nCardamom \nSouth \nKerala \nIdukki \nIsabgol \nNorth \nRajasthan \nJodhpur, Nagaur, Barmer, Jaisalmer \n \nPage 19 of 31 \n \nProduct \nRegion \nState \nDistrict \nCastor \nWest \nGujarat \nBanaskantha, Kutch, Patan, \nSabarkantha, Mehsana \nOrange \nWest \nMaharashtra \nNagpur, Amravati, Wardha \n \nAPEDA, MPEDA, EIC and other commodity Boards will provide the framework for \nownership of the supply chain starting from farmer registrations, FPO formation, \nprovision of quality inputs, price discovery, farmer training through technical \norganisation and third party certification. The implementation would require full \ninvolvement of State agriculture / horticulture / fisheries Department, State \nAgricultural Universities, ICAR institutions and Food Processing Department. This \nprogram can be clubbed with the Public-Private Partnership for Integrated Agriculture \nDevelopment (PPP-IAD) scheme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna as involvement of \nprivate industry is critical to market success.  \n \nThe effort will be to focus on developing export oriented infrastructure in the identified \ncluster areas where integrated post-harvest, processing facilities, laboratories etc. \nwould be set up with support from MOFPI (PMKSAMPADA) / DoC (TIES) / DAC&FW \n(MIDH) / DAHDF (IDMF), etc. to have export oriented farm production and processing \nin compliance with standardized protocols, packaging, sanitary and phyto-sanitary \nissues and linking and networking this to next level of marketing channel. \n \nIn the identified clusters, the effort would also be made for sharing of best practice in \nthe area of smart agriculture, use of mobile app for pest management, use of Artificial \nIntelligence, use of drones for monitoring and adoption of newer technologies in the \nfield like laser land levelers, propelled sprayers, precision seeders and planters, \ntransplanters for seedlings, multi-threshers etc. Renewed focus is required on seeds, \npesticides, fertilizers and proper utilization of water which can double the area under \nirrigation. \n \n6.2 Promoting value added exports \n6.2.A. Product development for indigenous commodities and value addition: \nIt is proposed that the agriculture export policy must focus on promotion of value \nadded, indigenous and tribal products. As highlighted in the previous sections, India’s \nexport basket is dominated by products with little or no processing or value addition.  \nStakeholders have recommended for financial support for commodities identified in \nthe indigenous category which include non-forest produce, wild herbs, medicinal \nplants, extracts, lac, essential oils etc. This would require intense export focused \nresearch for developing exportable products along with strong branding efforts.  \n \nStakeholders have suggested a financial package for development and research on \nvalue added products. For e.g. Cashew requires boost to be exported in value added \nform such as cashew apple jams and pastes, flavoured cashew, etc. currently, less \nthan 4% of cashew exports are in value added form (CNSL, Roasted/salted nuts). \nIndustry estimates suggest a significant quantity of exports head to countries which \nconduct limited value addition and re-export it.  \n \nPage 20 of 31 \n \nA preliminary exercise on a few processed food products revealed the following: \n \nPRODUCT  \nPresent \nlevel \nof \nexports  \nProjected \nexports in the \nnext 3 years  \nPotential markets  \nBiscuits & Confectionery \n$ 185 mn \n$ 350 mn \nAngola, USA, Haiti, \nNamibia, \nUganda, \nUAE, Nigeria, Kenya \nIndian Ethnic Foods \n$ 114 mn \n$ 200 mn \nUSA, \nAustralia, \nCanada, UAE, Nepal  \nCereal Preparations  \n$ 471 mn \n$ 800 mn \nUSA, Bangladesh, UK, \nNepal, UAE, Angola \nDehydrated onion, other \nvegetables \n& \nFrozen \nvegetables \nincluding \nGherkin \n$ 207 mn \n$ 400 mn \nUSA, \nGermany, \nBelgium, \nRussia, \nFrance \nProcessed fruits- juices, \nconcentrates \n$ 338 mn \n$ 600 mn \nSaudi \nArabia, \nNetherlands, Yemen, \nUK, \nUSA, \nAlgeria, \nKenya \n \n6.2.B. Promote value added organic exports: Currently, the organic exports from \nIndia is in the range of Rs. 3450 crore (2017-18). The global trade in Organic products \nis estimated to be in the range of US$ 90 billion. Therefore, the scope for improving \norganic exports, especially, value added organic from India is very high. Under the \naegis of the National Programme on Organic Production (NPOP), new categories of \nproducts such as livestock, aqua-culture having good potential for exports have been \nincluded. This is likely to give a boost to the value added organic exports. In addition, \nstandards on organic textile could also be included for looking at augmenting the value \nadded textiles to be exported from India. \n \nCurrently, the percentage of organic processed products export from India is only \n5.5% of the total organic food export. Only a limited range of products (mango pulp, \npuree, by-products of oil crops, soya meal, cakes and few ready to eat products) and \nsingle processed products such as sugar, tea, edible oils, coffee and essential oils are \nexported from India. India can look at exports of a whole range of value added fruits \nand vegetables, IQF Fruits and vegetables, Ready to eat products, Pickles, Soups and \nsauces, Dairy products, Processed livestock, Aquaculture products, textile products, \netc. Some of the ideas shared by stakeholders for promotion of value added organic \nexports is as follows: \n \n \nMarketing and branding of organic products  \nThe organic exporters have suggested that the gestation period for establishing an \norganic product in the retail market is long and cost of launching is very high.  A \nsupport for product registration, support for buying shelf space in the organic retail \nchains etc. have been floated by the exporters.  \n \n \nPage 21 of 31 \n \nAPEDA as the nodal organization for implementation of NPOP will take up the required \ncoordination for enhancing organic exports from India.   \n \n Develop uniform quality and packaging standards for organic and \nethnic products \n \nThere is increasing demand for value added, ready-to-eat and ethnic food from \ndeveloped nations, particularly arising from the migrant Indian population across the \nglobe. In the era of globalization and proliferating lifestyle diseases, quality conscious \nconsumers across the world are seeking comfort, respite and health benefits in their \nfood. India can offer a one stop solution and provide a range of ethnic products \nranging from healthy and organic to processed and convenient food. This is an \nexcellent opportunity for entrepreneurs to leverage our traditional food heritage and \ninvest in innovation in taste, packaging, fusion food and shelf life of food.  \n \nIndia’s 5000 year old traditional Ayurvedic food system can play the role of a potential \ngame changer. The world-renowned wound healing properties of turmeric, stemmed \nfrom traditional Indian knowledge. Much like the export of Yoga, it is this traditional \nknowledge that must be communicated to the world and marketing of products would \ninevitably follow. Use of Indian Ayurveda products, spices for ever-growing \nnutraceutical market is a promising prospective. \n \n Pickling is the art of preservation that Indians mastered long before modern R&D \nefforts to increase shelf life of food products.  \n Ready to cook/Ready to eat food with numerous variants of lentils, rice (poha), \nbiryani, chicken tikka masala, kebabs, samosas and parathas are popular across \nthe world. \n Namkeens/Snacks such as Murukku and Dal Mot are an excellent source of \nprotein which could replace fat rich snacks in the West.  \n MARKFED has been successful in exporting large volumes of branded, canned \nIndian cuisine like sarson da saag in countries such as US, UAE and Canada.  \nSimilarly, popular cuisine in different regions could be marketed in large volumes \nin overseas countries. \n \nHowever, standardization of physical and quality parameters has been ignored to \nsome extent in the largely unorganized, ethnic food industry. Apart from branding \ncampaigns, promoting ethnic cuisine requires standardization and development of \npackaging and quality protocols. Paneer and Rasgulla exports, for example, suffer \nfrom low shelf life, arduous sampling and excessive lead time which must be urgently \nreduced by developing relevant protocols. \n \n Organic products in North East \n \nAlthough quality organic products are available in North-eastern regions, export of \nthese products is not happening. In order to initiate exports, development of ‘AMUL’ \n– style cooperatives especially in the Eastern and North-Eastern Regions is required. \nIt would bring in discipline in procurement and well-oiled distribution network for the \nproducts from the region. Such co-operatives can undertake grading / sorting / testing \n \nPage 22 of 31 \n \nof products which can be further sold or processed. \n \n6.2. C. Promotion of R&D activities for new product Development for the \nupcoming markets: Fortification of food products is important in view of \nmalnourishment in children and ailments due to deficiency of key vitamins/minerals in \nthe diet. Also, there is increased interest in development of fortified food items for \nhealth benefits (gluten free, super grains, starch free etc).  The demand for new super \nfood including a lot of coarse cereals has been growing in the western countries.  Given \nthe small but robust production of coarse cereals in tribal pockets and rain scarce \nregions of India, there is a significant potential for augmenting exports from India. \nFSSAI would be urged to notify standards with regard to fortified products for domestic \nmarket which would result in higher exports. \n6.2. D. Skill development: As mentioned earlier, India has been supplying \ncommodities to markets in the global value chain which further do value addition and \nrealise higher returns on the product. India is a major supplier of frozen shrimp to \nVietnam. With the skilled manpower available in Vietnam, significant value addition is \nmade and re-exported to destination markets. India having advanced processing \nplants, superior quality system is unable to make much progress in export of value \nadded products. Lack of skill development facilities / curriculum is said to be one of \nthe lacunae in the system. \nWork force need to be provided with skill development opportunities on a regular basis \nto keep pace with changing customer preferences. Apart from the work force, Capacity \ndevelopment of different food processors, particularly from MSME and unorganized \nsegments is required to enable them to tap overseas markets and global agri-business \nvalue chain. With Government of India’s focus on skill development with establishment \nof a separate Ministry, skill development takes center stage.  \n \n6.3 Marketing and promotion of “Brand India” \nThe stakeholders have suggested constituting separate funds dedicated to marketing \nof organic, value added, ethnic, GI, Region specific and branded products. It is also \nrecommended that marketing campaigns be created for individual fruits or products \nsuch as “Wonderful Pom” and “Bananas of India”. This fund would primarily be utilized \nfor a sustained communication campaign in the form of a branding blitz across key \ntargeted markets. This must utilize both digital and traditional media platforms.  \n \nGovernment must continue its concerted efforts for targeted GI registration, \nstakeholder negotiation and preservation of GI tag. Marketing of our best products as \n“Make of India”, by stepping up of advertising and investing in GI of our unique \nproducts would sharply increase our exports. Exporters are to be encouraged to do \nproduct registration in target markets. \n \nRegion specific agriculture / processed products are popular with Indian diaspora and \nif given promotion also find place in the palette of importing country citizens also. For \ne.g. Makhana from Bihar, Agra petha, Hyderabadi biryani are popular and have distinct \nidentity. Value added products like Indian ethnic meals with 2-3 days shelf life can be \nproduced and air freighted daily to GCC & ASEAN Supermarkets. \n \nPage 23 of 31 \n \n \nDepartment of Commerce will work with the stakeholders for preparation of an \nestimate and take up with relevant ministries for implementation of such a marketing \ncampaign. \n \nIt would be worthwhile to do benchmarking of agriculture export promotion activities \nwith peer-group countries and best countries in the world. One of the examples often \ncited by stakeholder is the experiment carried out in Malaysia. Malaysia has introduced \na commodity branding programme called “Malaysia’s Best”. This is an umbrella brand \nfor the country’s horticultural products that guarantees quality and safety in \naccordance with Malaysian Standards and the Malaysian Good Agricultural Practice \nSystem. It was initiated for carambola, papaya, pineapple, mango and watermelon, \nbut is to be extended to all other commodities. In Malaysia all farmers can apply to be \ncertified although, initially, most certified farmers are contracted to the Federal \nAgricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) for delivery to supermarkets. Similar \ncampaign for Indian bananas, mangoes, pineapple, pomegranate, litchi, Indian tea \nand coffee, Indian spices could be initiated with joint efforts of exporters, autonomous \nbodies and IBEF. \n \nIndia produces a variety of Agriculture produces in different parts of the country. Due \nto its fragmented nature of production, aggregating farm production to fulfil large \norders becomes a difficulty even with big sized export companies. There is no \ninformation mechanism to ascertain the current stock available with different sources \nin different States. Currently the Indian agencies are performing specific tasks towards \nthe export development. However, specialized Field level marketing with order closure \nis not being taken up by any Agency. \n \nIn order to provide a platform for SHGs/FPOs/Cooperatives/Artisan groups, Agriculture \nexport policy proposes to establish a mechanism for linking all credible SHGs, FPO’s, \nCooperatives, Quality certified Private Processors and Traders etc. through a public \nprivate partnership mechanism including exploring the possibility of Development of a \nportal. The effort may involve providing e-commerce platform for direct linkage of \nFarmers’ cooperatives, producer societies, etc. for export linkage. \n \n6.4 Attract private investments in export oriented activities and \ninfrastructure. \nPost-Harvest Infrastructure supports smooth logistical movement of agri produce. This \nwill have a direct co-relationship in increasing export volumes, assuring quality & \nensuring better price realization per unit.  Some of the benefits are as follows:  \n \n Better quality compliance: Post Harvest processing of agri-produce, such as \nwaxing of fruits, irradiation treatment of meat, sorting of bad/damaged \nfruits/produce, will increase shelf life of the produce and will be helpful in \nmaintaining quality of the produce for distant markets. \n \n Facilitates smooth logistic handling: Will assure better handling of produce, \nresult in decreasing wastage, increase marketable surplus quantity. This will also \n \nPage 24 of 31 \n \ngenerate better price realization (both value & volume advantages), will increase \nvolume handling capabilities, thereby offering opportunities for expanding the \nSourcing/Catchment area. Warehouse facilities in the importing countries where \nIndia is a major exporter of agricultural products would help increase the current \nexports to that country. \n \n Expansion to distant markets: Smoother logistics, better quality & volume \nhandling capabilities will offer opportunities to expand to distant markets, \nimprove the shelf life/keeping quality of the produce and offer higher opportunity \nto cover farther export destinations. \n \nThe Infrastructure proposed to support agriculture exports from the Focus States \nincludes: \nPackhouse: \n Will help increase marketable surplus by assuring quality through grading & \nprimary processing of produce. \n Will provide the ability to cater to large volumes of produce for exports in shorter \npost- harvest windows. \n \nProcessing infrastructure:  \n Value addition to raw produce will help ensure consistent quality, longer shelf life, \nand better price realization. \n Will also provide the ability to expand to newer markets and capture new consumer \nsegments in current markets, thereby increasing export sales. \n \nCold storage:  \n Low temperatures decrease microbial & enzymatic activity, it will increase the shelf \nlife of produce by providing a constant low temperature environment and will \nincrease marketable surplus for exports. \n Will also provide ability to capture off-season/complimentary-season markets. \n \nExit Point Infrastructure:  \n Facilitates maintenance of uninterrupted ambient temperature chain (cool \nchain/cold chain) at the maximum distance possible. \n Provision of Perishable Cargo center, Cargo Freight Stations for container stuffing, \nReefer Containers, reefer plugs, scanners, facility to hold containers in vicinity of \nthe port area etc. ensure this from exit points to consumer gate. \n \nAir cargo: \n Highly valued agriculture products, Fresh and perishables are shipped by Air cargo. \nInfrastructure such as Centre for Perishable Cargo, loaders, vacuum cooling facility, \nwork floors, moving truck docs, designated and sufficient Perishables’ / Animal \nhandling / quarantine areas, Pallet container handling system, Automatic storage \nretrieval system at International & Domestic Airports would increase efficiency / \ncost effectiveness of export through air cargo. \n Possibility of developing new Greenfield Airports for cargo purposes may offload \nthe traffic from airports at Mumbai, Delhi etc. \n \nPage 25 of 31 \n \n \nInfrastructure abroad:  \n Essential infrastructure facilities for various agriculture products in the importing \ncountries where India is a major exporter of agricultural products would provide \nedge over competitors. It would help exporters to provide consistent supplies, \nmaintain inventory and reduce distribution costs. \n \nThe autonomous bodies and export promotion councils under the Ministry of \nCommerce will work with line ministries, State governments and exporters for \nidentification and bridging of some of the missing gaps pertaining to infrastructure \nfacilitating agricultural exports. Indian missions abroad should be equipped and \nactively involved in providing information on export prospects in various countries and \nfacilitating the exports.    \n \n6.4. A. Ease of Doing Business (EODB)& Digitization:  \n Farm level – digitization of farmer land records \nDigitization of land records, geo-mapping of lands, registration of farmers and farm \nproducer organizations (FPOs) is critical to implementation of a smooth agricultural \nexport policy. The Central Government has been working with the States to conduct \nwidespread campaigns to formalize tenancy, register land records and carry out \nsatellite mapping of lands while linking these details to farmer AADHAR cards. This \nwill be critical in establishing traceability, market linkages and plugging leakages in \npublic funds. Successful implementation of such digitization will facilitate consolidation \nand aggregation of land holding for export oriented cultivation. \n \n Market Intelligence cell at DoC and Portal for Information Dissemination   \nThere has been a consistent demand from exporters across sectors for a dedicated \nplatform to access trade and market related information. Recently, the DoC has \ncreated a portal on Trade Analytics which provides the trends for different \ncommodities in different markets.  Similarly, APEDA and MPEDA run `agri exchange \nportal’ and `fish exchange portal’ respectively to provide market intelligence to their \nstakeholders. India Trade portal is operated by FIEO with the support of DoC and it \nprovides information relating to tariff scenarios in FTA and non-FTA situations, the SPS \nnotifications and also provides a window for Indian Embassies to offer market leads. \nThus, relevant information on market intelligence is scattered in different web pages. \nEfforts will be initiated to develop an integrated online portal for real time updates \nrelating to tariff, non-tariff, documentation, pesticide & chemical MRL notifications. \nThis portal will facilitate exporters to make well-informed decisions related to markets, \npricing, hedging and SPS notifications. The portal may also include a grievance \nredressal mechanism allowing exporters to flag off market related issues and \nchallenges.  \n \nThere is a need to develop Manual of Importing Country Requirements (MICOR) for \nall the major agriculture products exports from India for all major importing countries. \nThe exporters would be able to look up for requirements of importing country and \ncomply, minimizing the risk of rejection of exported consignments. APEDA, EIC, \nMPEDA, commodity Boards and the Councils would develop, host and update the \n \nPage 26 of 31 \n \nMICOR. Regular workshops with exporters are also envisaged. \n \n Trade procedures and facilitation \nExporters reveal that lengthy and cumbersome documentation and operational \nprocedures at ports are a constant challenge (refer table below). They have often \nrecommended to implement 24 x 7 single window clearance of perishables imports \nand exports at key ports across the nation. It is equally important to station more",

In order to provide follow-up and resolution of issues \nrelating to export grievances the Trade Disputes Cell in the DGFT Office has been \nfunctional. The Trade Disputes Cell in the DGFT would be reoriented to function as a \nresponsive grievance cell for exporters and importers. \n \n6.4. B. Developing Sea Protocol: Developing sea protocols for perishables must be \ntaken on priority for long distance markets. Export of perishables requires special \nstorage, transportation and handling at desired temperatures. Time is a major \nconstraint and air freight proves costly for exporters while low volumes and poor \ninfrastructure make it unviable for airlines to transport produce. However, India’s \nexport of fresh produce can grow exponentially if sea protocols are established across \nexported/exportable varieties of shortlisted commodities. A sea protocol will indicate",
    "answer": "t what maturity level harvesting can be done for transportation by sea. This exercise, \nhas to be carried out in partnership with shipping lines, reefer service providers, ICAR \nand APEDA. Philippines and Ecuador are a classic case in point – both countries were \nsuccessful in developing sea protocols for exporting bananas for 40 and 24 days of \nsea journey respectively. Philippines has been shipping Bananas to the Middle East \nwhich takes around 18 days while India has only been able to ship this produce with \nonly 2-4 days transit period. Trials of sea protocol held at strategically important ports \nacross India are therefore an immediate requirement that must be taken up on war-\nfooting. This will go a long way in promoting trade.  \n6.5 Establishment of Strong Quality Regimen \n \nPage 27 of 31 \n \nThe role of FSSAI, EIC, plant and animal quarantine and different Commodity Boards \nin setting standards, enforcing such standards and a robust accreditation and \ncertification arrangement to identify export worthy establishments will be facilitating \nfurther exports.   \n \nThe facilitation in terms of a `Whole Government Approach’ in tackling SPS and TBT \nbarriers of other countries will also quicken the pace of market access as well as to \nlook at measures with regard to countries which are putting up unreasonable barriers.  \n \nAs part of India’s effort towards establishing a strong quality regime, the focus will be \non strong R&D, new varieties, state of the art lab and a lab networking process for \neffective accreditation and monitoring.   \n \n6.5. A. Establish and maintain single supply chain and standards for \ndomestic and export market:  \nMaintaining consistency in quantity and quality is important for getting export orders \non a sustainable basis. There has to be a convergence of policy related to quality \nstandards set for domestic market and those set for the export market. This is \nparticularly challenging for unorganized and fragmented sectors such as fruits & \nvegetables, livestock and dairy where traceability continues to elude. As a result, \nIndia’s agricultural produce often tends to fall short of standards laid by importing \nnations. Limited control over farm practices and domestic marketing also allows vested \nand competing interests to spread fears and stifle trade. The FSSAI is responsible for \nsetting standards for food manufactured in the domestic market as well as food \nproducts imported in to the country. However, export standards are laid down by \nvarious bodies under DoC which are a result of norms stipulated by importing nations. \nHigh quality Mangoes, bananas and cashew are exported while lower standard and \nsubstandard produce finds its way to the domestic market across the country. \nHarmonizing of domestic standards would result in overall improvement of quality of \nproduce, awareness regarding good agricultural practice and lower the transaction \ncost for exports.  \n \n6.5. B. SPS and TBT Response Mechanism: \na) It is common knowledge that issues relating to market access go on for months, \nsometimes years together before countries allow market access for products.  Apart \nfrom tariff barriers, which have been declining over the years on account of Free Trade \nAgreements & Regional Trade Agreements, the Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) and \nstringent",

    "question": "uality/phyto-sanitary \nstandards",
    "answer": "re \nbecoming \nthe \nnorm \nfor \nrestricting/preventing market access. It is necessary to respond to rapid alerts and \nwarnings and to ensure that the concerns/problem areas percolate to the \nproducers/processors and exporters. In the absence of a response mechanism, the \nlikelihood of temporary restriction/ ban looms large and sometimes it may take years \nto lift the ban. \n \nb) Apart from response to rapid alerts, the market access efforts require submission \nof pest risk analysis, dossier on animal health and disease control programme, \naddressing safety concerns of the importing countries/intending countries. Given the \n \nPage 28 of 31 \n \nmultiplicity of Departments/Agencies responsible for submitting/responding to these \nissues, it takes an unusually long time to respond, resulting in delay in market access. \n \nc) The residue levels in the food products, the testing protocol by the laboratories and \nthe tolerance levels followed by importing countries is an issue on which convergence \nof efforts are required. Instead of multiple agencies extending accreditation to \nlaboratories, an extensive mapping of competencies of labs along with their ability to \ncarry out tests in accordance with tolerance limits set by importing countries would \nobviate the need for multiple accreditations. As part of the Agriculture Export Policy, \nthe Department of Commerce proposes to have a single portal which will provide the \nfacility for single accreditation of labs and prevent different organizations from carrying \nout accreditation activities separately. NABL will be the lead organization for joint \nassessment and accreditation. This will also facilitate a root cause analysis in case of \ndefault and penalize the defaulting laboratories in case of irresponsible sampling or \ntesting mechanism for exported products.  \n \nSimilarly, drawing up residue monitoring plans (RMP) would help in a) creating online \nplatform for maintaining traceability, b) facilitating exports by standardizing testing \nprotocols. APEDA has already initiated this for grapes. As part of the Agri Export Policy \na similar initiative by Export Inspection Council is proposed for the shrimps being \nexported from the country. Efforts will be to continue traceability initiatives and bring \nmore and more agricultural products under its ambit. A template / framework for \ncapturing the details required in a traceability system through the participation of \nfarmers’ would be developed which could be implemented with the help of State \nGovernments.  \n \nd) Depending on the pesticides which are banned/prohibited by the importing \ncountries, sometimes a policy measure could be required in India, especially if, \nalternative pesticides are available. Registration of new pesticides by Central \nInsecticide Board (CIB), following the recommendation of their scientific panel may \ntake months and consequently force prevalence of pesticides which have been \nbanned/ found obsolete in importing countries. Sometimes, pesticides which are not \nregistered in importing countries (e.g. tricyclazole in EU) require exhaustive scientific \ndocuments to be submitted for which CIB needs to play a proactive role. \n \ne) Further, in case of export rejections of agri and food products, there is a need for \ndoing a root cause analysis and identifying the reasons for such rejection. The USFDA \nand European Union have developed a system of reflecting import rejections in their \nweb portal. As part of the Agriculture Export Policy, the Department of Commerce \nproposes to develop a common portal to monitor all export rejections and provide a \nplatform to different nodal agencies to take up a root cause analysis, take corrective \naction and in case of requirement, respond to the partner country regarding action \ntaken.   \n \nThus, in view of the above, it is suggested to create an institutional mechanism under \nthe aegis of Department of Commerce with representation of relevant Ministries, \nAgencies to address India’s market access request, calibrate it with trading partner’s \nmarket access request for accessing the Indian market and quickly respond to \n \nPage 29 of 31 \n \nSPS/TBT barriers. The mandate of the above institutional mechanism will look at the \nfollowing areas: \n \n(i) Issues pertaining to market access, viz. Pest risk analysis, risk assessment of \nfood products, submission of documents relating to animal disease control \nprograms, etc. efforts for accessing new markets and steps taken by respective \nagencies. \n \n(ii) NTBs faced by Indian agricultural, marine and processed products (including \nTea, Coffee, Spices) and strategies for overcoming the NTBs. The NPPO, EIC, \nother Export promotion bodies like APEDA, MPEDA need to bring out the \nrequirements and progress made between meetings. \n \n(iii) The status of our strength/ability for pre-export monitoring and quality testing \nfor different products, identifying gaps and roadmap for bringing our laboratory \nand other pre-export infrastructure at par with international best practices. \n \n(iv) Initiatives for online transactions, ensuring that systems developed by different \nagencies, viz. ICEGATE of Customs, DGFT’s software, Export Development \nAuthorities’ software talk to each other and reduce paper work for the \nexporters, as part of ease of doing business. \n \n(v) Addressing concerns of exporters relating to national standards, harmonising it \nwith Codex or other international standards, import clearance of ingredients by \nFSSAI, risk based inspection/client accreditation system for quicker \nexport/import clearance could also be discussed in this platform. \n \n6.5. C Conformity Assessment: Many importing countries do not recognize India’s \nexport inspection and control processes. The lack of recognition of Indian testing \nprocedures and conformity standards proves costly to exporters and therefore \nfarmers. Many times this means multiplicity and duplication of tests by various \nlaboratories across the country. Spices, organic food, Basmati products have been \nmost affected by this. Equally, the government must make concerted efforts during \nbilateral discussions for mutual recognition of ethnic and organic products and \nstandards. EIC, APEDA, MPEDA, Spice Board, etc. will continue to strive for conformity \nassessment procedure to be recognized for smooth export of agriculture exports. \n \n6.6 Research and Development \nStakeholders have often recommended the need to identify and utilize resources for \nexport-oriented product development and quality testing of identified commodities. \nThere is also a need for importing improved germplasm in some varieties of \nagricultural products. Suggestions on interventions required in R & D sector would be \nsought from stakeholders to ascertain the financial implications.  \n \nAgricultural research and development (R&D) led by private industry along with higher \ninfrastructure spend by the government will be the key to boosting agricultural \nexports. Decades ago, Indian agricultural R&D witnessed breakthroughs with the \n \nPage 30 of 31 \n \ngreen and white revolution. Since then, cereals have enjoyed higher allocation - in the \nfield and in the laboratory - as compared to horticultural crops. On the export front, \nPUSA Basmati 1121 is perhaps a good example of successful domestic research by \nIndian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to have brought in accolade and foreign \nexchange; the Basmati export industry quadrupled from being a less than US$ 1 Billion \nindustry to US$ 4 Billion after its introduction.  \n \nAlong with this, innovations in packaging, improving shelf life of products and greater \nR & D in developing products to suit the palates of importing countries would be a \npriority. The Autonomous Bodies under Department of Commerce, including Indian \nInstitute of Packaging will work with the stakeholders, MoFPI, ICAR, Council of \nScientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and State Governments in this direction. An \nefficient institutional framework is needed for technology transfer and extension \nservices for dissemination of information regarding export-oriented production. \n \n \nImporting export oriented germplasm \nThe long gestation period in seed development and commercialization is indeed a \ncostly barrier to boosting productivity. The private sector has displayed apprehension \nin technology transfer due to purported lack of adequate regulation and protection of \nIntellectual Property (IP) Rights. It has been proposed that the Central Government \nconstitute a corpus which will act as matching fund for importing germplasm and seed \nvarieties of identified exportable focus crops from breeders across the world. ICAR, \nAPEDA, Spices Board, MPEDA etc. and private industry must be the key stakeholders. \nFor each focus crop/product, livestock and aquaculture germplasm negotiations must \nbe carried out with leading exporters to frame a mechanism for providing grants \nmatching private contribution toward varietal import. It will be equally important for \nthe government to ensure better enforcement of IP Rights to encourage private \nparticipation. \n \n Exporters suggest there is a need to import patented coloured/self-thinning \ngrape varieties which are in demand in international markets.  \n Newly successful Indian grape varieties such as Nana purple, Krishna seedless \n(black seedless) and super sonaka, Manikchaman, SS, RK (white seedless \nvarieties), which are popular in the middle east need to be formally recognized, \nregistered with establishment of post-harvest protocols. \n Potato seed to be improved for better quality & longevity (e.g. Holland origin) \n Import less pungent varieties of garlic and white onions for exporting to EU  \n Internationally accepted pomegranate varieties of 500 gram size must be \nimported as against the average 300 gram sized fruit grown in India \n \n \nTesting labs with strong infra in NE region to support export of organic \nproduce \nWith single-minded export cluster focus, North East region has the potential to \nproduce exportable organic produce. Spices exporters have particularly shown interest \nin the organic/non-organic high quality turmeric, ginger and pepper grown in the \nregion. This would require setting up state-of-the-art testing and certification \nlaboratories for the products to be exported/imported. Currently, the produce is sent \nto Kolkata for testing which is logistically challenging and proves costly. It has been \n \nPage 31 of 31 \n \nproposed by stakeholders that an NABL accredited laboratory be set up in Guwahati, \nparticularly for the testing of spices. The aforementioned recommendation to upgrade \nstorage and handling infrastructure at Guwahati airport will be complementary to this \nmeasure.    \n \nFurthermore, the feasibility of setting up plant quarantine and testing laboratories at \nAkahura in Agartala, Sutarkandi in Karimganj, Dawki in Meghalaya, Moreh in Manipur \nand Zokhawthar in Mizoram must be carried out.  This would help promote and \nregulate informal trade at these stations via Myanmar en route to South East Asian \nnations.  \n \n6.7 Miscellaneous \n6.7. A - Creation of Agri-start-up fund: Entrepreneurs are to be supported to start \na new venture in Agri products exports during their initial period of establishment. A \nstart-up in the Agri export sector, which is going to work on a new concept / product \n/ project may submit its proposals. All such proposals would be referred to the fund \nmanager for its evaluation and provide funding for the deserving proposals which are \ngoing to aid in increasing agricultural exports from the country. For e.g. use of IT in \nthe agriculture value chain including precision farming, plant health monitoring, use \nof drones for precision agriculture, packaging, tracking of produce in transit may be \nsupported by the Fund. \nConclusion \nThe Policy aims at addressing a whole range of issues which could potentially propel \nIndia into the top bracket of agricultural exports. It has often been recognized that \nintegration in the global value chain is one of the most certain methods of adopting \nthe best agricultural practices along with attaining productivity gains and cost \ncompetitiveness. The objective of doubling the farmer’s income will invariably require \nhigh levels of income as well as improving in the food value chain.  \n \n \n***",

The Scheme was initiated in 1970-71 on the recommendation of \na technical committee on indices of input cost appointed by Government of India.The Scheme envisages \ncollection of representative data on inputs and outputs in physical and monetary terms on a comparable \nand comprehensive basis following a well-designed scientific sampling methodology which has been \ndesigned by the Expert Committees and is reviewed from time to time by the Committees set up for the \npurpose. Present sampling design is a three-stage stratified random sampling, with tehsils as first stage \nunits, a cluster of villages as second stage units and an operational holding in a cluster as the ultimate \nstage unit. For the purpose of drawing the sample, each State is divided into different agro-climatic zones \nbased on climate, soil type, cropping pattern, etc. The field data are collected on the Cost Accounting \nMethod by the IAs from 8100 sample operational holdings spread over 19 states. Daily entries of debit/\ncredit for the expenditure/income are made in order to assess the total cost/benefit incurred/accrued to \neach farmer covered under the scheme. \n2. \u0007The scheme presently covers major 25 crops(Paddy, Wheat, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, Ragi, Barley, Moong, \nUrad, Arhar, Gram, Lentil, Groundnut, Rapeseed & Mustard, Nigerseed, Safflower, Soyabean, Sunflower, \nSesamum, Cotton, Jute, Sugarcane, Onion, Potato and Coconut) and these crops are selected for a block \nperiod of three years. The Cost of Cultivation/ Production Estimates being generated with the data \ncollected under the scheme are used as an important input by CACP while recommending MSP of \nvarious crops. Apart from this, the data is also used by MoSPI for preparation of National Accounts \nStatistics. Marketed Surplus Ratio (MSR) which is required for various policy decisions is also compiled \nfrom this data.\n3. \u0007Presently, the scheme is being implemented in 19 States through 16 Universities/Colleges also known \nas State Implementing Agencies (IAs). Funds are released to IAs through Grant-in-Aid.  The Grants-in-\nAid are meant for meeting the salary, allowances and office expenses of the Implementing Agency staff \nworking in CS scheme.\n\b\nAppendices | 397\nAppendix-II\nExplanatory Note\nAdvance Estimates\nThe estimates of area, production and yield rates for 2020-21 are “Advance Estimates” as on 11.08.2021 \nand are based on deliberations held in weekly inter-disciplinary meetings of Crop Weather Watch \nGroup, availability of water in important reservoirs in the country area enumeration based on Remote \nSensing Technology, estimates from Econometrics Modeling, availability/supply of important inputs \nincluding credit to farmers community, feedback received from states etc. These estimates are “advance” \nin the sense that these have been prepared in advance of availability of results of CCE (Crop Cutting \nExperiments) and are subject to revision as more precise information flows over times from states to DES.\nYield\nYield rate is defined as production per unit of area. However, yield rates of various crops given in this \npublication may not exactly tally with the ratio of production to the corresponding area because figures of \narea and production of various crops have been generally rounded off in ten thousands.  \nPrincipal Crops\nPrincipal Crops as referred to in this publication include only those crops which are covered for prepara-\ntion of index numbers. The details of these crops are given in Appendix III.\nEstimation Procedure for Non-Availability of Data for 2020-21\nThe index numbers of area, production and yield rate for 2019-20 (from where growth rates have been \nderived) are based on advance estimates of principal crops as on 11.08.2021. However, there are a \nnumber of ‘non-forecast’ crops such as plantation crops and spices for which no advance estimates for \n2020-21 (or for that matter any year) are prepared. In such cases, the estimates of area and production \nfor the previous years are repeated for the purpose of index numbers.\nNine Oilseeds\nWherever “Nine oilseeds” is mentioned in this publication, it includes Castor seed, Groundnut, Linseed, \nNigerseed, Safflower, Sesamum, Soyabean, Sunflower and Rapeseed & Mustard.\n398 | Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021\nAppendix-III\nMethodology of Index Numbers of Area,  \nProduction and Yield\nBase Year \nThe Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) had adopted Triennium Ending (T.E.) 1981-82 as base \nyear for the purpose of Index Numbers of Area, Production and Yield in Agriculture until 1999-2000. In \n2000-2001, it was decided to adopt T.E. 1993-94 as a way of updating the base to a recent year and keep it \nin harmony with the other series of indices such as Index of Industrial Production, Wholesale Price Index \nand the series of National Accounts Statistics. Since area and production in agriculture can fluctuate a \ngreat deal from year to year, the average of area/ production over the TE 1993-94 was taken as the base \nyear. \nIt was observed that the base year 1993-94 used for construction of index numbers of Area, Production \nand Yield of crops has become outdated and stressed on the need for updating of the base year at regular \nintervals preferably in consonance with the base year revisions of other important indices.\nAs the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 remained normal from agriculture point of view and the price data \navailable with CSO was for the year 2006-07 which could be used as mid period price for assessment of \ncontribution in value terms for preparation of weighting diagram, it has been considered appropriate to \ntake more recent base, i.e., (TE 2007-08 = 100) as the base for agricultural indices.\nWeighting Diagram\nThe weight of a commodity for the production index is taken as the average production of the commodity \nin the T.E. 2007-08 and the national average price of the commodity during 2006-07 as obtained from \nthe National Accounts Statistics. This has been done to fix the base production at its average level by \neliminating the cyclical variation and to evaluate the production with the same price for all States in view \nof wide variations observed in the state prices. \nMethodology\nLet \t\naij\t\n- the area under ith crop in the jth year. \n\t\naio \t\n- the area under ith crop in base year period. \n\t\npij\t\n- production

The estimates of area and yield rates assume prime importance in the entire gamut of \nagricultural statistics. \nArea Statistics\nFrom the point of view of collection of area statistics, the States in the country are divided into three \nbroad categories. The first category covers States and UTs which are cadastrally surveyed and \t the \narea \nand land use statistics are built up as a part of the land records maintained by the revenue agencies, \nthese states are called “Land Record States” or temporarily settled States. This system is followed in 18 \nmajor states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam (excluding hilly districts), Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, \nHimachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, \nRajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and 4 UTs of Chandigarh, Delhi, Dadra \n& Nagar Haveli and Puducherry. These States/UTs account for about 86% of reporting area and are \ncovered under Timely Reporting Scheme (TRS) under which 20% villages are selected at random for \ncomplete area enumeration.  \nThe second category includes those States where area statistics are collected on the basis of sample \nsurveys conducted under the scheme of Establishment of an Agency for Reporting of Agricultural \nStatistics (EARAS). This scheme was introduced in Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal, and later extended to \nArunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.  The scheme envisages, inter-alia, estimation of area \nthrough sample surveys in a sufficiently large sample of 20% villages/ investigator zones.  These states \naccount for about 9% of reporting area. \nThe third category covers the hilly districts of Assam, the rest of North-Eastern states (other than \nArunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim), Goa, UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Daman & \nDiu and Lakshadweep where no reporting agency had been functioning. In this category of states, work \nof collection of Agricultural Statistics is entrusted with the village headmen. The area statistics in these \nstates are based on impressionistic approach. These areas/states account for 5% of the reporting area. \n \n1.3 Yield Estimates\nThe second most important component of production statistics is yield rates. The yield estimates of major \ncrops are obtained through analysis of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCE) conducted under scientifically \ndesigned General Crop Estimation Surveys (GCES). At present over 95% of the production of foodgrains \nis estimated on the basis of yield rates obtained from the CCEs. Field Operations Divisions (FOD) of the \nNational Statistical Office (NSO) has been providing technical guidance to the States and Union territories \nfor organizing and conducting Crop Estimation Surveys for estimating yield rates of principal crops. In \naddition, NSO in collaboration with States/Union Territories implements sample check programmes on \narea enumeration work, area aggregation and conduct of crop cutting experiments under the Scheme \nfor Improvement of Crop Statistics (ICS). While executing the programme of sample checks on crop \ncutting experiments, the FOD associates itself with the operational aspects of the conduct of crop cutting \nexperiments right from selection of sample villages, training of field staff to the supervision of field work, \n426 | Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021\nand in the process gathers micro level information relating to conduct of crop cutting experiments for \nestimation of crop yield. NSO regularly brought out its annual publication entitled “Consolidated Results \nof Crop Estimation Surveys on Principal Crops”. \nThe primary objective of GCES is to obtain fairly reliable estimates of average yield of principal food \nand non-food crops for States and UTs which are important from the point of view of crop production. \nThe estimates of yield rates thus arrived at are generally adopted for the purposes of planning, policy \nformulation and implementation. The CCEs consist of identification and marking of experimental plots \nof a specified size and shape in a selected field on the principle of random sampling, harvesting and \nthreshing the produce and recording of the harvested produce for determining the percentage recovery of \ndry grains or the marketable form of the produce.\n1.4 Coverage\nThe crop-wise details of number of experiments planned under GCES during 2016-17 are given in  \nTable 1.1\nTable1.1: Experiments Planned under GCES during 2017-18\nCrop Type/Crop                                 \nNo. of Experiments Planned\n \nKharif\nRabi\nTotal\n1.   Food Crops\nPaddy\n355475\n30179\n385654\nWheat\n-\n399917\n399917\nJowar\n31538\n20624\n52162\nBajra\n74365\n14198\n88563\nMaize\n82238\n8270\n90508\nRagi\n12002\n2142\n14144\nBarley\n-\n10000\n10000\nGram\n-\n65157\n65157\nSugarcane*\n24561\n439\n25000\nOther Crops\n170892\n106844\n277736\nTotal\n751071\n657770\n1408841\n2.   Non-Food Crops\nGroundnut\n46773\n15140\n61913\nSesamum\n26879\n4073\n30952\nCastor\n5871\n-\n5871\nRape & Mustard\n-\n80435\n80435\nLinseed \n-\n1937\n1937\nCotton\n53580\n386\n53966\nJute\n3802\n-\n3802\nMesta\n622\n-\n622\n\b\nAppendices | 427\nCrop Type/Crop                                 \nNo. of Experiments Planned\n \nKharif\nRabi\nTotal\nOther Crops\n27760\n19621\n47381\nTotal\n165287\n121592\n286879\nTotal (1+2)\n916358\n779362\n1695720\nSource: AS Wing, NSO (FOD), Faridabad\n*439 experiments of Sugarcane are of Rabi season in West Bengal.\n1.5 Sampling Design \nStratified multi-stage random sampling design is generally adopted for carrying out GCES with tehsils/ \ntaluks/ revenue inspector circles/ CD blocks/ anchals, etc., as strata, revenue villages within a stratum \nas first stage unit of sampling, survey numbers/fields within each selected village as sampling unit at \nthe second stage and experimental plot of a specified shape and size as the ultimate unit of sampling as \ndepicted in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1: SAMPLING DESIGN for GCES\nTehsil / Taluk\n↓\nRevenue Village\n↓\nSurvey Number / Field\n↓\nExperimental Plot\n(Specified size / shape)\nIn each selected primary unit, generally 2 survey numbers/fields growing the experimental crop are \nselected for conducting CCE. Generally, 80-120 experiments are selected in a major crop growing district, \nwhere a district is considered as major for a given crop if the area under the crop in the district exceeds \n80,000 hectares or lies between 40,000 and 80,000 hectares but exceeds the average area per district in \nthe State. Otherwise, the district is considered as minor for a given crop. Experiments in minor districts \nare so adjusted that the precision of the estimates is fairly high and the workload on the field staff is \nmanageable. On an average, about 44 or 46 experiments are planned in a minor district. The number of \nexperiments allotted to a district is distributed among the strata within the district roughly in proportion \nto the area under the crop in the stratum. \n1.6 Advance Estimates of Area and Production\nThe period of an agricultural crop year is from July to June, during which various farm operations from \npreparation of seed bed, nursery, sowing, transplanting various inter-culture operations, harvesting, \nthreshing etc. are carried out. Different crops are grown during the agricultural seasons in a crop year. \n428 | Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021\nFinal estimates of production based on complete enumeration of area and yield through crop cutting \nexperiments become available much after the crops are actually harvested.  However, the Government \nrequires advance estimates of production for taking various policy decisions relating to pricing, marketing, \nexport/import, distribution, etc.  Considering the genuine requirement of crop estimates much before the \ncrops are harvested for various policy purposes, a time schedule of releasing the advance estimates has \nbeen evolved. These estimates of crops are prepared and released at five points of time during a year as \nenumerated below.\n1.7 First Advance Estimates\nThe first advance estimates of area and production of Kharif crops are prepared in September every \nyear, when south-west monsoon season is about to be over and Kharif crops are at an advanced stage of \nmaturity. The assessment is made by the State Governments based on the reports from the field offices of \nthe State Department of Agriculture. They are mainly guided by visual observations.  These are validated \non the basis of inputs from the proceedings of Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG) meetings, and other \nfeedback such as relevant availability of water in major reservoirs, availability/supply of important inputs \nincluding credit to farmers, rainfall, temperature, irrigation area enumeration based on Remote Sensing \nTechnology, estimates from Econometrics Modeling etc.  \n \n1.8 Second Advance Estimates\nThe second advance estimates are made in the month of February every year. The advance estimates \nof Kharif crops may undergo a revision in the light of flow of more precise information from the State \nGovernments. The Second Advance Estimates then cover the second assessment in respect of Kharif \nCrops and the first assessment in respect of Rabi Crops. \n1.9 Third Advance Estimates\nThe third advance estimates are prepared in the month of April-May every year. The earlier advance \nestimates of both Kharif and Rabi seasons are firmed up/ validated with the information available with \nState Agricultural Statistical Authorities (SASAs), remote sensing data, available with Space Application \nCentre, Ahmedabad as well as the proceedings of CWWG. \n1.10 Fourth Advance Estimates \nThe fourth advance estimates are prepared in the month of July-August every year. Since most of the Rabi \ncrops get harvested by the end of May, SASAs are in a position to supply the estimates of both Kharif and \nRabi seasons as well as likely assessment of summer crops. Like the third advance estimates, the fourth \nadvance estimates are duly validated with the information available from other sources.\n1.11 Final Estimates\nUnder the existing system of crop estimation, the fourth advance estimates are followed by final estimates in \nthe month of February of the following agricultural year. The main factors contributing to the relatively large \nnumber of crop estimates are the large variations in crop seasons across the country and the resulting delay \nin the compilation of yield estimates based on crop cutting experiments.  As agriculture is a State subject, \nCentral Government depends upon State Governments for accuracy of these estimates. For this purpose, \nState Governments have setup High Level Coordination Committees (HLCC) comprising, inter-alia, senior \nofficers from the Departments of Agriculture, Economics & Statistics, Land Records and NSSO (FOD), IASRI, \nDES from Central Government for sorting out problems in preparation of these estimates in a timely and \norderly manner. \n1.12 \u0007Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land \nbased observations (FASAL)\nUnder the FASAL scheme,  forecasts of area, production and yield based upon Remote Sensing and \neconometric modeling are generated. The agencies involved under the scheme are Space Application \n\b\nAppendices | 429\nCentre (SAC), Ahmedabad, Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), New Delhi and India Meteorological \nDepartment (IMD). Under the scheme, multiple in-season forecasts of area & production of specified \ncrops at National/State level are envisaged. Inputs from remote sensing, weather and field observations \nare used for validating the forecasts and inferences for desired coverage, accuracy and timeliness.  \nDA&FW has established Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) on April 23, 2012 which \noperationalises Remote Sensing Methodology on crop forecast and drought assessments in collaboration \nwith ISRO.  These forecasts are used to validate the official crop estimates based the conventional system. \nMultiple forecast of 11 major crops namely Rice (Kharif & Rabi), Jowar (Kharif & Rabi), Maize, Bajra, Jute, \nRagi, Cotton, Sugarcane, Groundnut (Kharif & Rabi), Rapeseed & Mustard and Wheat were envisaged at \nNational/State/District level. However, based on the technological feasibility and requirement, 11 crops \nare modified to Rice (Kharif & Rabi), Jowar(Rabi), Maize (Rabi), Soybean, Jute, Pulses (Rabi), Cotton, \nSugarcane and Groundnut(Rabi), Rapeseed & Mustard and Wheat.  Presently, the experimental forecasts \nin respect of 8 crops are being prepared namely, Wheat, Rice (Kharif and Rabi), Jute, Sugarcane, Cotton, \nRapeseed/mustard, Rabi sorghum and Rabi Pulses.\nThe programme uses optical and microwave remote sensing data of Indian and foreign satellites. The \nfield data (ground truth) collection is carried out using Smartphone. The activities are carried out in \ncollaboration with 19 State Agriculture Departments, 16 State Remote Sensing Centres, ISRO, IMD, IEG \nand State Agriculture Universities.\n1.13 Achievements of FASAL project\nFASAL is a national level project of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare under Integrated Scheme on \nAgriculture Census, Economics and Statistics. Under FASAL project, pre-harvest multiple Crop production \nforecasts at District/State/National Level are generated for 8 major crops (Rice, Wheat, Cotton, Sugarcane, \nJute, Rabi Jowar, Rabi Pulses and Rapeseed & Mustard) using satellite and agro-meteorological data. \nIn a year, all total 16 forecasts (Rice-3, Wheat-3, Rapeseed &Mustard-3, Jute-1, Cotton-2, Sugarcane-2, \nRabi Pulses -1 and Rabi Jowar-1) are generated. The results are shared with DAC&FW, State Agriculture \nDepartments and other partner agencies. \n1.14   Extended Range Forecast System (ERFS)\nThe IMD has been providing weather forecast with lead-time of five days only and that too for four broad \ngeographical regions of the country. It leaves little lead-time to farmers for undertaking crop management \ndecisions. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has sponsored \na project entitled “Development and Application of Extended Range Forecast System for Climate Risk \nManagement in Agriculture (ERFS)” since 2006 in collaboration with other partner organizations, viz., \nIndian Institute of Technology (IIT), India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium \nRange Weather Forecast (NCMRWF), Space Application Centre (SAC) Ahmedabad and Indian Council of \nAgriculture Research (ICAR). \nThe project aims at generating extended range deterministic and probabilistic rainfall and temperature \nforecasts for metrological sub-divisions of India at monthly and seasonal scale and disseminating it to \nthe farming community and to advise them about various measures. The project was completed on \n31st October, 2018 and outcome has been transferred to IMD and MNCFC. The weather forecasting of \nprecipitation and air temperature on monthly and seasonal scale has immense importance in agriculture \nas it offers extra lead time to farming community for decision making in adverse conditions.\n***\n430 | Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2021\nAPPENDIX X: RAINFALL IN 2021\nS.NO.\nMETEOROLOGICAL\nSUB-DIVISIONS\nTOTAL RAINFALL IN  WINTER-2021\nTOTAL RAINFALL IN PRE-\nMONSOON-2021\nTOTAL RAINFALL IN \nMONSOON-2021\nTOTAL RAINFALL IN  POST-\nMONSOON-2021\nTOTAL RAINFALL IN YEAR 2021 \n(JAN.

    "question": "uality of the yield data of the Crop \nCutting Experiments (CCEs) is limiting the effectiveness of crop \ninsurance in the country. The need for improving the yield \nestimates using remote sensing and other technologies is well \nrecognized and the research in this direction has gained \nmomentum in recent years. This report documents the scope for \nreplacing the current CCE-based yield estimates with model-based \nyield estimates for crop insurance.  A quick review of the recently \npublished research and the results of the studies carried-out by us \nformed basis for this report.  It is observed that modeling crop \nyields at local scales such as Insurance Units is complex and is \nconstrained by scarcity, scale and quality of input data related to \nweather, soil, crop variety, crop management etc. Therefore, more \nfocused research is needed for replacing the current CCE-yield \nestimates with modeled yield estimates.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nGrowing concern on the quality of the yield data of the Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) is \nlimiting the effectiveness of crop insurance in the country.

    "answer": "bout 40-50% for major crops like paddy, wheat, rabi jowar etc. However, critical elements like \nsampling/model error and calibration of historic yield data limit its operational implementation. \n \nThe three widely adopted approaches for yield modeling are Semi-empirical, Crop Growth \nSimulation and Artificial Intelligence models. \n \nSemi-empirical methods are based on bio-chemical process of plant – light absorption for \nphotosynthesis, radiation use efficiency, stress factors, accumulated biomass and grain yield. \nThese models are found to be performing well at regional scales for some of the crops. \nAvailability of precise information on crop variety, planting and harvest date and derivation of \nwater stress and temperature stress factors are critical elements in this methodology for local \nlevel application. \n \nCrop growth models simulate the plant processes to estimate various bio-physical parameters and \nfinal crop yield. All these models are best designed for point based application. These models \nneed intensive parameterization such as genetic coefficients of crop varieties, crop sowing time, \ncrop management practices – fertilizer applications, irrigation supplies, pest/disease occurrence, \nlocal weather parameters etc. These data intensive models tend to perform poorly when applied \nin spatial perspective covering  IUs/Blocks/Taluks.  \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become popular in solving the non-linear relationships between \nthe variables particularly in the bio-physical framework involving crop yield estimation.  AI \nincludes Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. In recent years, AI models \nhave gained momentum for crop yield estimation.  Critical issues in these models are feature \n \n \n \nselection, optimization of model parameters, consistency of results, scale etc. These models are \nalso data intensive, if the estimates are targeted at local scales.  \n \nThe key challenges with yield modeling methodologies that impact the indemnity assessment \nand basis risk in crop insurance are (a) generation of modeled yield estimates for the past years, \n(b) consistency of model errors and control on such errors and (c) ability to parameterize all the \ncrop risks that occur during crop’s life cycle. These models use bio-physical variables such as \nsoil moisture, LAI, APAR etc which are currently available at much coarser resolutions. \nDownscaling of these variables to finer scales is associated with uncertainties, affecting the \naccuracies of the models.  \n \nMagnitude and direction of model errors in the yield estimates of past and current years are very \ncritical in determining the indemnity values for claims settlement and minimizing the basis risk.  \n \nDistrict/state level crop yield estimation using the above models is still not operational in the \ncountry even for principal crops, due to various limitations. Crop yield estimation at local scales \nsuch as IUs, is more challenging than that of district/state level, due to higher variability and \nlesser scope for parameterization. Similarly, yield estimation for non-cereal crops is more \nchallenging than that of cereal crops, due to various reasons. \n \nTherefore, more focused research is needed for replacing the current CCE-yield estimates with \nmodeled yield estimates in crop insurance.  Cereal crops may be targeted first and based on the \noutcome; such research for non-cereal crops may be initiated. \n \nTill the methodology for generating modeled-yield estimates is ready, technology interventions \nto reduce dependence on the CCE-yield data can be explored by developing yield-proxy \nindicators at least for major crops.  \n \nIn this direction, AICIL and NRSC developed and implemented an innovative index-based \ninsurance scheme linking pay-outs to satellite based crop performance index rather than yield \nmeasurements.  The scheme, first of its kind in the country, was successfully implemented in \n2020-21 for different crops   in West Bengal state. Such technology-driven index-insurance \ninsurance schemes may trigger a paradigm shift in the crop insurance system benefitting all the \nstakeholders. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \n \nSection \nTitle \nPage no. \n1 \nIntroduction \n1 \n2 \nStrategies for improving the yield data \n2 \n2.1 \nImprove the current CCE mechanism \n3 \n2.2 \nReducing the sample size in CCE \n3 \n2.3 \nReplacing CCE yield data with modeled yield data \n5 \n2.3.1 \nEmpirical model – parametric regressions \n5 \n2.3.2 \nSemi-empirical model \n5 \n2.3.3 \nCrop simulation models \n6 \n2.3.4 \nAI models (Machine Learning/Deep Learning based regressions) \n7 \n2.3.5 \nHybrid approaches \n11 \n2.3.6 \nSummary of the results of the recently published papers on crop yield \nestimation \n11 \n2.4 \nModel error and its impact on indemnity \n13 \n2.4.1 \nBasis risk \n16 \n2.6 \nMerits and demerits of different strategies for improving yield data   \n16 \n3 \nConclusions and way forward \n17 \n4 \nAcknowledgements \n18 \n5 \nReferences \n18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nList of Figures \n \nSection \nTitle \nPage no. \n1 \nSmart sampling based CCE-fields selection in Odisha state \n3 \n2 \nCCE-reduction methodology framework \n4 \n3 \nSimulated soybean yield, kharif 2019, Maharashtra \n7 \n4 \nSoybean yield estimates for the year 2019 \n8 \n5 \nTehsil wise reported yield and predicted yield, Latur district \n9 \n6 \nCircle wise reported and predicted yield, Akola and Washim districts \n9 \n7 \nWheat yield estimated using Random Forest model \n10 \n8 \nSimulation of indemnity using the modeled-yield estimates for \ninsurance payouts \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \nList of Tables \n \nSection \nTitle \nPage \nno. \n1 \nRF model performance with different combination of input features \n10 \n2 \nSummary of the results of the recently published papers on crop yield \nestimation \n11 \n3 \nTest data on modeled-yield estimates for simulating indemnity values \n14 \n4 \nStrategies for improving the crop yield data for crop insurance \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n1.0 Introduction \n \nGlobally, agriculture is exposed to multiple hazards leading to frequent crop losses. As a result, \ncrop insurance has become an indispensable risk management tool in agriculture sector \n(Vermeulen et al., 2012). Better management of agricultural risks is one of the important \nstrategies to address the current challenges of food security, income security and climate \nresiliency of Indian agriculture. Increasing crop risks coupled with low growth and outreach of \ncrop insurance signify huge potential for crop insurance in India. A robust system of crop \ninsurance is the need of the hour to reduce the impact of covariate risks in agriculture and \npromote innovations and investments in farming sector.   \n \nAgricultural risk sharing through crop insurance  has been in existence in many counties, in \nmany forms  for many decades (Skees et al. 2005) but most of these products are being supported \nby huge subsidies from the Governments (Ibarra and Skees 2007). Highly subsidized agricultural \ninsurance products have serious implications on the sustenance of crop insurance in the future \n(Atwood 1996, Barnet 2004, Mahul 2010).   Therefore, the need for developing innovative crop \ninsurance products that are  actuarially stronger,   has been largely recognized by both developed \nand developing nations in recent years (Anonymous 2014,  Leblois and Quiron 2013). \n \nIndia has a long history of implementing various crop insurance schemes with improvements \nfrom time to time, to insulate the farming community against various cultivation risks (Mishra \n1996, Singh 2013). Traditional crop insurance was introduced in the country in the year 1965 \nfollowed by Comprehensive Crop insurance scheme (CCS) in 1980’s and 1990’s, weather based \ninsurance schemes in 2003 and National Agricultural Crop Insurance Scheme (NAIS) in 2004 \nand Modified NAIS (MNAIS) in 2010 (Anonymous 2014). In the existing crop insurance \nschemes, estimation of loss and indemnity payment are decided by weather index or crop yield \nindex over an area. NAIS and MNAIS, the most popular area-yield  crop insurance schemes, \nhave faced  serious limitations – subjective crop yield measurements, inadequate coverage, \naccuracy and transparency (Anonymous 2014). As a result of these deficiencies,   basis risk has \nincreased and indemnity payments have consistently exceeded the premiums even in years of \ngood weather conditions (Rao 2010, Anonymous 2014).  \n \nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) being implemented in the country from kharif \n2016, is an area-yield insurance contract that has many positive features to compensate for \nmultiple risks during the entire life cycle of the crop season. Use of technologies viz. remote \nsensing, mobile and data analytics is mandatory for effective implementation of the scheme. \n \nDespite bringing improved versions of crop insurance schemes from time to time, the biggest \nchallenge in the crop insurance continues to be generation of accurate  crop yield data in the \ninsurance units (Anonymous 2014, Murthy 2018).   Availability of reliable, current and historical \ncrop yield data, particularly in developing countries poses a serious challenge for objective \nassessment of crop loss, pricing and indemnity payment in area-yield index schemes (Smith and \nWatts 2009). Limited number of yield measurements and subjectivity in measurements are \nserious limitations in the current system of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs). As a result, the \nestimated yield of an insurance unit tends to deviate   from the true yield level leading to data \ndisputes and delay in claims settlements.  \n \n2 \n \n \nBias in the CCE-yield data is generally on the lower side as observed from various reports, news \nitems and views of different stake holders. Such under-estimation of crop yields in the insurance \nunits, has cascading effects on the entire chain of insurance. Yield data quality disputes delay the \nclaims settlement process. Reduced yields attract higher payouts, reflecting higher risk and \nhigher cost of insurance (premium rate) in subsequent years. Increased premiums are the result \nof artificial risk caused by biased yield. Thus, the purpose of crop insurance compensating for \nnatural risks will be defeated once the data-induced artificial risk creeps in to the system. \n \nAnother impact of the biased data is that it reduces the threshold / guaranteed yield of the crop \nfor an insurance unit which is based on the average of preceding 5-7 years yield in the insurance \nunit Therefore, the probability of experiencing less than the threshold yield (which is already on \nlower side due to past series of biased data) gets minimized gradually over a period of time. As a \nresult, the insured farmers would be either not indemnified or partially indemnified despite \nfacing crop losses. Consequently, the crop insurance contract will become a futile and pointless \nrisk management instrument rather than risk reducing instrument, as the farmers may end-up \npaying the premiums without getting the compensation for crop loss in return.   \n \nTherefore, the current thrust area in crop insurance is development of technology interventions to \nimprove the yield data and strengthen crop loss assessment system. This report documents the \nopportunities and challenges for improving the crop yield data for crop insurance. Emphasis is \nplaced on the scope for replacing the current CCE-based yield estimates with modeled-yield \nestimates for crop risk assessment.  This is done based on  quick  review of the recently \npublished research papers and the results of the studies carried-out by us. \n \n2. Strategies for improving the yield data  \n \nTechnology interventions in the form of using satellite data and mobiles to improve crop yield \nestimation are largely recognized and promoted (Raju and Ramesh 2008, World Bank 2011, \nAnonymous 2014). Various limitations in the current system of crop yield estimation in the \ninsurance units along with ways and means to improve the system by using satellite, mobile, GIS \ntechnologies and data analytics were well documented by Murthy et al. (2018).  \n \nDepartment of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW), Ministry of \nAgriculture, Government of India has taken-up many initiatives to improve crop yield estimation \nprocedure ever since the launch of PMFBY in 2016 (www.pmfby.gov.in).  Bringing technologies \nin to crop yield estimation mechanism of PMFBY is one of the prime tasks being addressed by \nvarious agencies in the country.  Realization of this goal is in progress through step-by-step \nimplementation of new techniques in a phased manner. This is because the new techniques have \nto be tested for consistency of results and scalability.  \n \nImproving the crop yield estimation using technologies includes three major strategies  \n \n• \nImprove the current CCE process through smart sampling,  \n• \nReduce CCE number through optimization techniques and  \n• \nReplace CCE through alternate methods. \n \n \n3 \n \n 2.1 Improve the current CCE mechanism  \n \nThe most ideal approach is to increase the number of CCE in each insurance unit and follow \ndigital process for executing the crop cutting procedure. This will lead to statistically sound \nestimates with transparent process and objective measurements. Multiple factors – logistics, \neconomics, time lines, trained man power etc. prohibit the implementation of this approach. \nMoreover, the historic yield data which were derived from limited CCE measurements and the \ncurrent yield data based on increased-CCE measurements are not comparable. Calibration of \nhistoric yield data is a big challenge.  \n \nThe second approach is adoption of smart sampling for selecting the existing fixed number of \nplots and use mobile technology for digital recording of the crop cutting process. CCE-fields \nselection (Fig.1) through satellite based smart sampling technique replacing the existing random \nnumber methodology, was first developed and implemented by NRSC (ISRO) and Department \nof Agriculture, Government of Odisha, in Odisha state in 2018-19 (Murthy et al. 2019). \nSubsequently, it is being up-scaled to many districts from 2019-20, by MNCFC at the initiative \nof DACFW, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India. Thus, smart \nsampling with Mobile-app based recording of crop cutting have improved the quality of CCE \ndata  to a certain extent, but not to the desired extent.  \n \nFigure 1 Smart sampling based CCE-fields selection in Odisha state \n \n(a) Paddy crop map                              (b) CCE-field locations (primary plots and alternate) \n \n \n \n2.2 Reducing the sample size in CCE  \n \nIn the CCE-reduction methodology, CCEs are conducted at aggregated level say Block/Taluk \nand the resulting yield data is used to derive the estimates at IU level. \n \nNRSC and AICIL have developed and tested the methodology for CCE reduction for wheat crop \nin Ujjain district under a collaborative project (Fig. 2). The first approach involves conducting \nCCE in a limited number of fields determined on the basis of different yield indicators. This \nyield data will be used to develop empirical/semi empirical models with yield indicators. These \n \n4 \n \nmodels are then applied to generate yield estimates at disaggregated level i.e., insurance units. \nThese models vary from place to place and with crop stages.  \n \nThe second approach is to divide the distinct into homogeneous zones on the basis of weather, \nsoil and crop parameters. These zones are localised, contiguous and represent similar crop \ngrowing environments. The crop yield proxies developed based on satellite and other indices \nbetter capture the variability in localized areas.  For each zone, wheat crop yield proxy was \ndeveloped using NDVI, LSWI and back scatter ratios. The yield proxy has ranged from 0-1 and \neach zone was divided in to five yield proxy classes. Now, actual crop yield value corresponding \nto each yield proxy class was estimated by conducting CCE. The CCE derived average yield of \ndifferent yield proxy classes are used to estimate the yields of individual insurance units within \nthe zone, through area weighted approach. Results indicated that CCE number can be reduced by \nabout 40-50% without compromising with accuracy. However, there is a need to replicate the \nmethodology for one more season to check the consistency of results. Many agencies have \ndeveloped techniques for CCE-reduction but the reports on outcome are not available in public \ndomain, to draw any conclusions. \n \nFigure 2 CCE-reduction methodology framework  \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nCritical issues in CCE reduction methodology are; (a) strong yield proxy at appropriate \nresolution/granularity, (b) optimal grouping of insurance units, (c) sampling/model error in the \nestimates and (f) calibration of historic yield data. \n \n2.3 Replacing CCE yield data with Modeled yield data \n \nCrop yield estimation is a complex problem because many factors such as weather, soil, crop \nvariety, crop management etc are involved. Such estimations at local scales like insurance units \nin India is even more challenging and complicated than regional scale estimations because \ncapturing variability at local scales demands higher degree of parameterization. Replacing CCE \nyield data with modeled yield data is being attempted by many agencies in the country. There are \nfour widely followed  modeling approaches for  generating yield data;  \n \n• Empirical – parametric regressions \n• Semi-empirical \n• Crop simulation models  \n• Artificial Intelligence (AI) models  \n \n2.3.1 Empirical model – parametric regressions \n \nParametric regression functions are developed using yield and spectral and agro-met variables. \nSatellite indices covering single or multiple growth stages are employed. This approach is very \nprimitive in nature because of limited parameterization and lack of generalization. Quite often \nthey result in large error of estimates due to weak predictive power of independent variables.  \nTherefore, this approach is not suitable for crop insurance applications. \n \n2.3.2 Semi-empirical model \n \nIt is based on Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) model proposed by Monteith, 1977. This model is \nbased on bio-chemical process of plant – light absorption for photosynthesis, radiation use \nefficiency, stress factors, accumulated biomass and grain yield. It is recognized as a better \napproach than simple empirical modeling. Its strength lies in adopting a process-based \nframework with limited parameterization.  \n \nTripathy et al. (2014), adopted this model for generating wheat yield estimates at District and \nState level in India and suggested its operational use for regional estimations. The modeled yield \nand observed yield are with close relationship at State level with R2 of 99% but with poor \nrelationship at district level with R2 of 55%. They have attributed such a drastic fall in accuracy \nof modeled yield estimates from state to district level, to   identification of planting dates. \nTherefore, application of this model at finer scales such as insurance units which are much \nsmaller regions within districts may not produce accurate yield estimates due to inadequate \nparameterization. MNCFC (DACFW) adopted this technique to generate yield proxy in the smart \nsampling methodology for CCE fields selection but the evaluation reports are not available to \nunderstand the sensitivity of the yield proxy at local level  like insurance units. \n \n \n6 \n \nChen et al. (2020) used this model for estimating the yields of canola, barley and wheat and \nfound that the model has explained 87%, 69% and 83% of the observed field scale grain yield \nvariability. Dong et al. (2020) implemented this model for estimating winter wheat yield in \nKansas state of the USA and found that estimates were able to explain 69% of variability in the \nreported yields at county level, when wheat variety was included in the model. Without variety \ninformation, explaining power of the model is reduced to 64%. There are many other studies \nacross the world on this model, producing mixed results. In most of the studies,  yield estimation \nwas attempted at  aggregated level to characterize the yield gaps or to assess inter annual \nvariability of yield. There are no proven cases of applying this model to generate yield estimates \nat local scales. \n \nCritical elements of RUE model application that impact the accuracy of yield estimates are \nsummarized as under; \n• precise information on crop variety, planting and harvest dates \n• empirical derivation of FAPAR with NDVI \n• derivation of water stress and temperature stress factors \n \nTemperature and water stress are the two important limiting factors and quantifying these two \nparameters at local scales like insurance unit remains a big challenge. This model would result in \npotential yield rather than actual yield if the stress factors are not accounted with right data and \ntechnique. The model cannot be applied for part of the season, because constant RUE is \napplicable only when the entire crop growth season is considered.  Availability of cloud free \nmoderate resolution (10-30m) NDVI and LSWI datasets throughout the crop season may not be \npossible. Most of the research reported on this model adopted coarse resolution data, which are \nnot suitable for insurance needs. \n \n2.3.3 Crop simulation models \n \nCrop growth models simulate the plant processes to estimate various bio-physical parameters and \nfinal crop yield. These models need intensive parameterization starting from genetic coefficients \nof crop variety under cultivation, crop sowing time, crop management practices – fertilizer \napplications, irrigation supplies, pest/disease occurrence etc. These are highly reliable point \nbased or location specific models due to availability of input parameters in experimental plots. \nThese models better serve the needs of plant breeders in their experiments while developing new \nvarieties. All these models are best designed for point based application. When applied over \nlarger geographies, these models perform poorly due to limited parameterization and inadequate \nrepresentation of varied crop growing environments (Hochman et al. 2009, Palaso et al. 2011, \nKamir et. al. 2020, Manivasagam and Rozenstein 2020). Regional scale application of these \nmodels is well reported despite accuracy levels are poor. Adoption of crop simulation approach \nto meet the yield data needs at local scales i.e., smaller geographic units like insurance units is \nalso expected to result in poor accuracy levels. More research is needed to customize these \nmodels to suit the crop insurance requirements, particularly to address parameterization, \nscalability and accuracy factors. \n \nWe have implemented DSSAT crop growth simulation platform to simulate soybean and  cotton \ncrops growth and yield. This work is being carried-out under MahaAGRITECH project a \n \n7 \n \ncollaborative project of Department of Agriculture, Government of Maharashtra, Maharashtra \nState Remote Sensing Applications Centre and NRSC (ISRO). Input data used in the model \nincludes daily max & min temperature (Source: IMD AWS), Daily Solar Radiation (IMD AWS), \nDaily Rainfall (IMD AWS), Soil data - Depth wise texture, BD, pH, Organic carbon, water \nholding capacity etc. (NBSSLUP soil map at 50K), crop management - Start of the sowing and \nirrigation information derived from satellite images and used to drive simulation, other \nmanagement factors taken as per the standard local practices. Soybean yields were generated at \nrevenue circle level for kharif 2019, as shown in Fig. 3. These estimates were found to be with \n70-80% accuracy based on first level validation analysis. Model improvement activities are in \nprogress. \n \nFigure 3 Simulated soybean yields, kharif 2019, Maharashtra  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.3.4 AI models (Machine Learning / Deep Learning based regressions) \n \nCrop yield has high variability across space and time owing to variations in weather, edaphic, \nmanagement factors and genotypes. Spectral data of a crop is the integrated manifestation of the effect of \nall the above factors and hence, satellite data has significant role in regional crop yield assessment. Since \ndecade, remote sensing spectral data has been incorporated into different statistical, agro-meteorological, \nand simulation models for crop yield assessment. Each approach has its own limitation like statistical \nmethods are location specific and parametric in nature while agro-meteorological and simulation models \nare highly data intensive. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained importance  in solving the \nnon-linear relationships between the variables.  AI includes Machine Learning  and Deep Learning  \nmodels, such as the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and different variant of neural \nnetwork models (NN). In recent years, AI models have gained momentum in crop yield estimation. \nSatellite derived vegetation indices, meteorological data, hydrological variables and edaphic factors are \nused in these models (Jiang et al. 2004, Jeong et al. 2016,  Ma et al. 2016 ). \n \n2.3.4.1 Soybean yield estimation \n \nThis work is also being carried-out under MahaAGRITECH project along with crop simulation \nmodels. The current study covers three of the major soybean growing districts of Maharashtra \nnamely  Latur (for Tehsil level yield estimation), Akola and Washim (for Circle level yield \nestimation).  \n \n \n8 \n \nFor Tehsil level yield modeling (TLM), seven input features were used -  MODIS derived season \nmaximum FAPAR, season maximum NDVI and season maximum LSWI,  LPRM-AMSR2 \nderived average soil moisture during June-July period and August-September period and \ncumulative rainfall and rainy days during June to September.  Soybean yield data at Tehsil level \nduring 2012 to 2018 was used to train the model and 2019 yield data was used for model \nvalidation. \n \nFor Circle level  yield modeling (CLM) the input features include  Sentinel 1 derived season \nmaximum VH backscatter, dynamic range of VH from the start of the season to the maximum \nvegetative stage of the crop, and area under the VH curve between the start of the season and \nmaximum vegetative stage, Sentinel 2 derived season maximum NDVI and cumulative rainfall \nand rainy days during June to September.  Here, both the training and validation was performed \non stratified samples of 2019 dataset. Yield data of 75% circles were used to train the model and \nthe rest 25% were used for validation. \n \nDifferent deep neural network (DNN) configurations were tested via brute force algorithm and it \nwas found that a configuration of, input-36-36-18-18-output, performs well on TLM where as a \nconfiguration of, input-256-128-32-output, performs well on CLM.  Since the data density of all \nthe features used in the modelling is different, Adam optimizer was selected as an optimiizer \nwith a learning rate of 0.001.Leaky RelU activation function and Root Mean Square Error \n(RMSE) loss function were used in both the models.  To avoid over fitting and to ensure overall \nmodel generalization, different regularization criteria were applied during the training process. \nThese were: early stopping criteria based on training and validation loss, dropout of 0.2 in each \nlayer and a scheduler which reduces the learning rate of the optimizer by a factor of 0.1 after \nevery 50th epoch. \n \nIn TLM, the training and validation RMSE was found to be 173 Kg/Ha and 187 Kg/Ha \nrespectively, whereas, in CLM, training and validation RMSE was found to be 113 Kg/Ha and \n109 Kg/Ha respectively. Even though the RMSE’s are slightly on a higher side, but the spatial \ndistribution of the predicted soybean yield suggests that the trend in yield variability is well \nexplained by the proposed DNN models. Soybean yield estimates as Tehsil and Circle level for \nthe year 2019 are shown in Fig. 4 and the comparison between the reported yield and the \npredicted yield is shown in Fig. 5. \n \nFigure 4  Soybean yield estimates for the year 2019 \n(a)  Tehsil level yield  in Latur district     (b) Circle level yield in Akola and Washim districts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nFigure 5 Tehsil wise reported yield and predicted yield, Latur district \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Circle wise reported and predicted yield, Akola and Washim districts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6 compares the DNN predicted circle level yield with the actual yield. It can be deduced that \nthe error in model estimate at lower yield ranges are significantly less than those at higher yield \nrange. By doing further analysis, we found that the model performance was fairly good in lower \nand medium yield ranges but at higher yield ranges there was under-estimation. \n \n2.3.4.2 Wheat Yield estimation in Ujjain district \nIn this project, CCEs for wheat crop were conducted for the study, at 178 location spread across \n10 Gram Panchayats (GPs) of the Ujjain district in an area of 5m X 5m each. Grain weights \nalong with its moisture content were measured in-situ and afterwards, all the yield data were \nbrought to a common grain moisture content of 14 percent. The crop yield ranges from 7 Q ha-1 \nto 60 Q ha-1.  \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\nHatrun\nDahihanda\nMedshi\nAgar\nAlegaon\nKamargaon\nBarshitakali\nHadgaon\nBabhulgaon\nMundgaon\nShirpur\nPatur\nAkolkhed\nKawatha\nKupata\nAasegaon\nAdgaon\nKenwad\nMungala\nCop Yield (Kg/Ha)\nReported Yield\nDNN Predited Yield\n \n10 \n \n \nRandom Forest (RF) technique was used to model the wheat crop yield by utilizing time series \nNDVI& NDWI (Sentinel 2), GPP (LandSat 8) and XPR (Sentinel 1) datasets from 1st fortnight of \nNovember 2017 to 2nd Fortnight of March 2018. 75% of the dataset were used to train the model \nand 25% of the dataset were used for model validation. The modeling was done sequentially by \ninjecting indices one after other into the RF model. This led to four different combinations of \ninput features: (a) Using only temporal NDVI, (b) Temporal NDVI & Temporal NDWI together, \n(c) Temporal NDVI, NDWI & GPP together and (d) All the four temporal indices together into \nthe RF model. \n \n It was observed that at each successive addition of a variable in the model, there was significant \nimprovement in R2 and RMSE. From the initial stage, there was decrease of about 25% in model \nRMSE when all the four indices were utilized for modelling. RF model’s assessment of \nvalidation dataset with different combination of input feature is presented in Table 1. \nSubsequently, the RF model trained on temporal NDVI, NDWI, GPP and XPR {stage 4} dataset \nwas implemented across Ujjain district and wheat crop yield for rabi 2017-18 was estimated (Fig \n3). \n \nTable 1: RF model performance with different combination of input features  \n \nModelling \nstage \nParameters used in RF model  \n(all temporal) \nNumber of \nparameters \nRMSE \n(Q/Ha) \nR2 \nStage 1 \nNDVI \n10 \n9.8 \n0.69 \nStage 2 \nNDVI+NDWI \n20 \n8.7 \n0.76 \nStage 3 \nNDVI+NDWI+GPP \n28 \n7.6 \n0.83 \nStage 4 \nNDVI+NDWI+GPP+XPR \n38 \n7.4 \n0.85 \n \nFigure 6 Wheat yield estimated using Random Forest model \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKlompenburg et al. 2020 reviewed the research publications on Machine learning / deep learning \nalgorithms on crop yield prediction and indicated that the most challenging aspects are selection \nof best model and best input datasets and suggested further research to address these challenges. \nThey found that the most used data sets in the model are features on temperature, rainfall, and \nsoil type, and the most applied algorithm is Artificial Neural Networks. Despite numerous \n \n11 \n \nresearch reported on crop yield estimation using various models, the performance of these \nmodels are still to be improved to desired levels (Filippi et al. 2019). ANN based machine \nlearning model performed well for predicting rice yields in Bangladesh (Islam et al. 2021) \n \nAny deep learning model requires large volume and variety of dataset during training process. \nTherefore, to achieve at stable and robust DNN model for yield prediction, a large volume of \ncrop yield data at all yield ranges (low, medium, high) is required. In the presented case of yield \nestimate at aggregated and disaggregated level,  the data availability at lower and higher yield \nranges were limited and hence we observed inaccuracies in model prediction in those ranges. \n \nCritical issues in the operational use of AI models are are model selection and optimisation of \nmodel parameters, consistency of results, scale of model development etc. These models are also \ndata intensive, if the estimates are targeted at local level i.e., insurance units. \n \n2.3.5 Hybrid approaches \n \nCombination of crop model and empirical model was adopted by Lobel et al. (2015),  for \nestimating the yields of soybean and maize across multiple regions and years covering \nMidwestern US, Crop model derived  yield and bio-physical indices and weather based indices \nare used to train the statistical models and these models are applied on satellite and weather \nindices to generate yield estimates. The model estimates have captured 35% variability in maize \nyield and 32% variability in soybean yield. The authors conclude that many avenues exist to \nimprove the model performance. \n \n2.3.6 Summary of recent research on yield modeling \n \nBy reviewing the recently published literature on crop yield estimation, the results and critical \nfactors reported are summarized in Table 2.

Currently, indemnity levels for different crops in \ndifferent seasons range from 70-90%. Indemnity level of 90%, means 90% of normal yield is \nguaranteed by the crop insurance contract. Normal is the average of past 7 years yield.  Area-\nyield insurance contract guarantees certain % of normal yield called Threshold Yield (TY). The \nper cent shortfall from the TY is applied on the sum insured to arrive at compensation pay-out, \nfor a given IU. \n \nThe error in the modeled yield estimates of the current and past years plays a crucial role in the \nuse of such estimates for indemnity assessment and pay-out execution under crop insurance \ncontracts. The impact of model error on indemnity is showcased here using a test data set in \nTable 3. \n \nIf the errors are not accounted, the current year’s yield 3500 kg/ha, is greater than the TY by \n12% and hence no indemnity is to be paid, as indicated in the Table. \n \nThe error in the modeled estimates is assumed to be varying from 10 to 25% on both sides (+/-) \nand accordingly the actual yield estimates after adjusting the error are shown in Table 3. \nNegative error indicates that the yield is under estimated and positive error indicates over-\nestimated yield. Magnitude and direction of error in the yield estimates of current and past years \nimpact the indemnity. For example, if the model error is same,  say -10% or -20%, or -25%, for \nthe current as well as past years, the resulting indemnity % is constant, even after correcting the \nestimates for error as seen in Table 3. This is a hypothetical situation and the probability of its \noccurrence is very less. \n \n \n14 \n \nTable 3 Test data on modeled-yield estimates for simulating indemnity values \n \n  \n  \nActual yield after applying the model  error (%) \n Year/details \nModeled  \nyield \nkg/ha \n-10% \n-15% \n-20% \n-25% \n+10%  \n+15%  \n+20%  \n+25%  \nCurrent year (Yn) \n3500 \n3889 \n4118 \n4375 \n4667 \n3182 \n3043 \n2917 \n2800 \nPast years \n    \nYn - 1 \n4000 \n4444 \n4706 \n5000 \n5333 \n3636 \n3478 \n3333 \n3200 \nYn - 2 \n2900 \n3222 \n3412 \n3625 \n3867 \n2636 \n2522 \n2417 \n2320 \nYn - 3 \n3500 \n3889 \n4118 \n4375 \n4667 \n3182 \n3043 \n2917 \n2800 \nYn - 4 \n3800 \n4222 \n4471 \n4750 \n5067 \n3455 \n3304 \n3167 \n3040 \nYn - 5 \n3200 \n3556 \n3765 \n4000 \n4267 \n2909 \n2783 \n2667 \n2560 \nPast years average \n3480 \n3867 \n4094 \n4350 \n4640 \n3164 \n3026 \n2900 \n2784 \nThreshold yield - \nTY (90%) \n3132 \n3480 \n3685 \n3915 \n4176 \n2847 \n2723 \n2610 \n2506 \n% dev. from TY \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \nIndemnity (%) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0  0 \n 0 \n 0 \n 0 \n \nIn the scenario of positive error in the current year and negative errors in the past years’ \nestimates, the indemnity outcomes with corrected yield estimates are shown in Fig. 7.   Here, it is \nevident that +10% model error in the current year leads to an indemnity ranging from 9 to 24% \ncorresponding to the  errors of -10% to -25% for the past years (Fig 7a). Model error of +25% in \nthe current year resulted in the indemnity levels of 20 to 33% corresponding to the model errors \nof -10 to -25% in the past years. \n \nIf model errors in the yields of historic years are on negative side, the yields will be \nunderestimated and hence the threshold yield will always be on lower side. This leads to reduced \nindemnity situation in the current season, if the errors are unaccounted.  \n \nIf the model error in the yields of past years is on positive side, the yields are over-estimated and \nhence the threshold yield will always be on higher side. This leads to higher indemnity value for \nthe current season.  \n \nIn the situation where the model error of the past years is on positive side and that of current year \nis on negative side, the resulting indemnity for the current year will be on higher side, with \nuncorrected estimates. \n \nWhile using modeled yield data in crop insurance, the indemnity value consists of actual yield \nreduction due to crop risk as well as yield changes due to model error. Higher the model error \nlarger is the deviation of indemnity from the reality and larger is the basis risk. Therefore, \nmagnitude and direction of model errors in the yields of past and current years play a critical role \nfor adoption of modeled-yield estimates in crop insurance. \n \n15 \n \n \nFigure 7 Simulation of indemnity using the modeled- yield estimates for insurance payouts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.4.1 Basis risk \n \nReview by Smith and Watts (2009) indicates that index-based insurance schemes in developing \ncountries are faced with serious problems of basis risk and non-availability of historical data, \nmaking the scalability and sustainability of  agricultural insurance in the long run, a big \nchallenge.  \n \n In the area-yield insurance, indemnity is based on the yield loss experienced at the insurance \nunit level. There is a possibility that a farmer who suffered crop loss may not be indemnified and \nalso a farmer who experienced no yield loss could be indemnified. Basis risk indicates the \nprobability that the crop loss is not compensated or indemnified. Consequently, in such insurance \nunits, farmer-participants face the un-indemnified risk and forego the premium as well, thus \nmaking the insurance, a risk-enhancing contract.  \n \n \n(c) +20% model error in the current years’s \nyield estimates \n(d) +25% model error in the current years’s \nyield estimates \n(a) +10% model error in the current years’s \nyield estimates \n(b) +15% model error in the current years’s \nyield estimates \n \n16 \n \nThere are two important elements in the modeled-yield estimates that impact the basis risk; \n \n• model errors and their variability from year to year as discussed above and  \n• ability of the models to parameterize all the crop risks that have occurred during the crop \nseason. \n \nIf any of the crop risks are not adequately captured, it leads to underestimation of crop loss. \nGenerally, these risks include (a) Unseasonal rains/Floods/Cyclones (submergence, lodging, panic harvest \netc), (b) Weather aberrations such as hot and dry winds, rise in temperatures (poor grain setting and grain \ndevelopment), (c) Weather induced pest/disease incidence and (d) Pest  incidence following floods (BPH \nin rice) \n \n2. 6 Merits and demerits of different strategies for improving yield data   \n \nDifferent strategies for improving the crop yield data in the insurance units and their merits and \nlimitations are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4 Strategies for improving the crop yield data for crop insurance \nStrategy \nScope of adoption \nImprove CCE \nIncrease the  CCE number (to 10/12 per IU), smart sampling for fields \nselection and smart phones for digital recording of crop cutting process. \nAdvantages \n• \nStatistically valid  yield estimates \nLimitations: \n• \nOperational feasibility due to huge increase in CCE number  \n• \nStill prone to human bias \n• \nCalibration of past years data/estimates  \nReduce CCE \n \nReduce the CCE number using Technology based yield proxies, sampling \nestimates and empirical modelling  \nAdvantages \n• \nimproves quality, timeliness and economics of CCE \n• \nReduces moral hazard to some extent \nLimitations: \n• \nSampling / model error \n• \nModelling errors \n• \nCalibration of past years data/estimates  \nReplace CCE \n(modelled yield) \nModeled yield estimates through semi-empirical, simulation, Machine \nLearning/Deep learning, hybrid models \nAdvantages \n• \nNo CCE and hassle free \n• \nReduces moral hazard \n• \nTimely availability of data and estimates \nLimitations: \n• \nModel parameterisation  \n• \nuncertainty/error in estimations \n• \nCalibration of past years data/estimates \n \n17 \n \n3. Conclusions and way forward \n \nThe biggest challenge in the crop insurance continues to be generation of accurate crop yield data in the \ninsurance units. Improving the area-yield insurance either through (a) increasing/optimising CCE number \nor (b) adopting technology-based estimation is yet to be realised  due to various factors discussed in this \nreport. \n \nResearch on technology-based crop yield estimation using Crop Simulation and Artificial \nIntelligence models has gained momentum in recent years.  \n \nThe key challenges with yield modeling methodologies that impact the indemnity assessment \nand basis risk in crop insurance are (a) generation of modeled yield estimates for the past years, \n(b) consistency of model errors and control on such errors and (c) ability to parameterize all the \ncrop risks that occur during crop’s life cycle. These models use bio-physical variables such as \nsoil moisture, LAI, APAR etc which are currently available at much coarser resolutions. \nDownscaling of these variables to finer scales is associated with uncertainties, affecting the \naccuracies of the models.  \n \nMagnitude and direction of model errors in the yield estimates of past and current years are very \ncritical in determining the indemnity values for claims settlement and minimizing the basis risk.  \n \nDistrict/state level crop yield estimation using the above models is still not operational in the \ncountry even for principal crops, due to various limitations. Crop yield estimation at local scales \nsuch as IUs, is more challenging than that of district/state level, due to higher variability and \nlesser scope for parameterization. Similarly, yield estimation for non-cereal crops is more \nchallenging than that of cereal crops, due to various reasons. \n \nTherefore, more focused research is needed for replacing the current CCE-yield estimates with \nmodeled yield estimates in crop insurance.  Cereal crops may be targeted first and based on the \noutcome; such research for non-cereal crops may be initiated.",

    "question": "uantifying the frequent and localized phenomena that affect the crop production is a main \nchallenge in the area-yield crop insurance (Ibarra and Skees 2007). Carter et al. 2016, found that \nyield risk is not predicted by the index insurance in some of the agro-ecological regions of their \nstudy area.  \n \nInsurance products have to developed meeting the local crop growing conditions, for effective \ntransfer of risks; otherwise such products may produce maladaptive outcomes (Muller et al \n2017). Innovative measures including the use of technology have to be constantly introduced in \ninsurance to overcome the  challenges of agriculture insurance  such as moral hazard, fraudulent \nclaims etc and ensure the sustenance of these contracts (SwissRe 2013).  \n \nWay forward \n \nReplacing the CCE or reducing the dependence on CCE is the need of the hour to address the \never increasing crop yield measurement risks in crop insurance. Till the operational methodology \nfor generating modeled-yield estimates is ready, technology interventions to reduce the \n \n18 \n \ndependence on CCE-yield data by using yield-proxy indicators for major crops needs to be \ndeveloped.  \n \nIn this direction AICIL and NRSC developed an innovative index-based insurance scheme \nlinking pay-outs to crop performance proxies rather than measured losses. The scheme, first of \nits kind in the country, was successfully implemented in 2020 crop season  in West Bengal state. \nThe conventional ‘Area-yield approach’ has been   replaced by ‘Area- crop performance/crop \nhealth approach’. A composite index called Crop Health Factor (CHF), has represented the crop \nperformance by incorporating multiple physical and biophysical parameters related to crop \nhealth. It is a quantitative measure of crop health and its overall performance. CHF deviation \nfrom the past years’ average decides the crop loss and insurance pay-out in the current season. \nEnd-of-the crop season risks like hailstorms, floods, cyclones have also been accounted in the \ncrop performance.  \n \nThis new index-insurance is has many advantages over the conventional yield-based scheme in \nterms of transparency, objectivity and ease of implementation. There is scope for improving the \nindex with additional features. Such technology-driven index-insurance insurance schemes may \ntrigger a paradigm shift in the crop insurance system benefitting all the stakeholders. \n \n4.

This \n \nwill bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz.  Farmers, States, \n \nInsurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.  \n2.2 \n \nThe successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who \n \nwill have the  responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code \n \nmapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module.  \n2.3 \n Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and \n upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum \ninsured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance \nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate \nfarmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State \nGovt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions \netc. \n2.4 \n Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender \ndocuments which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance \nCompany immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order. \n2.5 \n Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and \nseamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to \ncreate/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.  \n2.6",
    "answer": "ll Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the \n \nPortal for administration of the Scheme.

However they may provide all requisite support to \n \nfacilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer’s details on the Portal well within the \n \nprescribed cut-off dates. \n2.9 \n \nOnly farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for \n \nInsurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released \n \naccordingly. \n2.10 \n \nAll data pertaining to crop-wise, area-wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area, coverage \n \nand claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop \n \nInsurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation etc. \n2.11 \n \nBanks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s \n \ndata electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to \n \nundertake CBS integration in a time bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.  \n2.12 \n  \nIt is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention \n \nScheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real time \n \nsharing of information and better program monitoring. \n2.13  \nInsurance Companies shall compulsorily use technology/mobile applications for monitoring of crop \n \nhealth/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also \n \nfacilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones by way of prior approval of \n \nagency from which such data can be sourced. This is required for better monitoring and ground-\n \ntruthing.  ICs can be active partners in facilitating use of technology. \n2.14  \nStates shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such \n \nas crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other \n \nrelated technology for CCE planning, yield estimation, loss assessment, assessment of prevented \n \nsowing and clustering of districts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n3 \n3. \n Coverage of Farmers \n3.1 \n \nAll farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas \n \nare eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured \n \ncrops. The non-loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land \n \nrecords prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/ \n \nor applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State \n \nGovt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective \n \nStates in the notification itself. \n3.1.1 \n Compulsory Component \n3.1.1.1 \nAll farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial \nInstitutions (FIs) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily. \nThis provision shall override any decision taken by FIs including PACS exempting farmers from \ncompulsory coverage of loanee farmers. \n3.1.1.2 \nHowever non-standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned \nBanks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered compulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate  such  \nfarmers for enrolment as non-loanee farmers . \n3.1.1.3 \nMerely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/jewel \nloans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and \nnotified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme. \n3.1.2 \n Voluntary Component \n• The Scheme is optional for non-loanee farmers.  \n• The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt. \nnotification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.   \n3.1.3  \nSpecial efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the \n \nScheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved  in extension and awareness \n \ncreation amongst farmers and obtaining feed-back of farmers about the implementation of the \n \nScheme  \n3.1.4 \n The implementing Insurance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary \nmeasures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers. However \nother empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for \nenrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non-loanee farmers at L1 \npremium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days \nof finalisation of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the \nInsurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in \nthe given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be \ntaken up on a pilot basis in Districts notified by State Govt.  They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n4 \nconditions laid down in Para 17.5.  \n3.1.5 \n These Insurance Company will maintain separate data of such non loanee farmers covered by them \nand enter the said data on the portal as per seasonality discipline detailed in Para 16.2. They shall be \nliable for payment of claims to such farmers. \n3.1.6 \n The exchange of information, co-witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by \nGovernment/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to \naccept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non-loanee \nenrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency. \n4. \n Coverage of Crops \nI. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses), \nII. Oilseeds \nIII. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.  \n \nIn addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops \nfor which standard methodology for yield estimation is available. \n5. \n Coverage of Risks and Exclusions \n5.1 \n \nFollowing stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new \n \nrisks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted. \n5.1.1  \nPrevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/ \n \nplanting/germination due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions. \n5.1.2  \nStanding Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses \n \ndue to non-preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease \n \nattack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone. \n5.1.3  \nPost-Harvest Losses: Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting, \n \nfor those crops which are  required to be dried  in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field \n \nafter harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone, Cyclonic rains and Unseasonal rains. \n5.1.4  \nLocalized Calamities: Loss/damage to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified \n \nlocalized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and Natural fire due to lightening \n \naffecting isolated farms in the notified area. \n5.1.5  \nAdd-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing  \n \nadd-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be \n \nsubstantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be \n \nissued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry of Environment and Forest and GIC Re.  \nThe  \n \nadd-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable notional premium will be borne by the \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n5 \n \nfarmer, however the State Govts may consider providing additional subsidy on this coverage, \n \nwherever notified. The  actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid \n \nitself from the  Insurance Companies, however the  add-on actuarial premium  rate \nwill \nbe \n \nconsidered separately  and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.    \n \n5.1.6  \nGeneral Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other \n \npreventable risks shall be excluded. \n5.1.7  \nState Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above \n \nwhich is  not prevailing in their State/UT \n5.1.8  \nYield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of \n \nindividual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies \n \nis essential. For remaining risks losses are due to widespread calamities. Hence lodging of \n \ninformation for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is \n \nnot essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield \n \nsubmitted by concerned State Govt. \n6. \n Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme \n6.1 \n \nStates: \n \n \nIssuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply \n \ntheir acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions \n \nrelating to PMFBY which are binding on States/UTs are as follows: \n6.1.1  \nAdoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct \n \nof CCEs through CCE-Agri App  and use of  NCIP platform for  flow of information and auto \n \nadministration of the scheme \n \n6.1.2  \nState has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified \n \ninsurance unit area; \n6.1.3  \nCCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance \n \nCompany within the notified cut off date ; \n6.1.4  \nState/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision  for  premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at \n \nthe beginning of the crop season; \n6.1.5  \nTo carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology. \n6.1.6  \nDepartment of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National \n \nAgriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated \n \nas Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop \n \nInsurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorized to \n \noversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n6 \n \nconstitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present \n \ncomposition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture \n \nDept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’ \n \nRepresentatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI \n \nmay co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary. \n6.2 \n \nInsurance Company: \n \n \nEmpanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme \n \n(PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The \n \nempanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for \n \nimplementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified major activities: \n6.2.1  \nTo carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in  a \n \ntransparent manner,  \n6.2.2  \nDeployment of requisite  infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,  \n6.2.3  \nCommitment for at least 10  % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,  \n6.2.4  \nDeployment of sufficient manpower to co-observe CCEs and allied activities and compulsory use of \n \nCCE Co-observation app,  \n6.2.5  \nAllocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and \n \ncapacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be \n \nsubmitted to Central and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season. \n6.3 \n Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer: \n6.3.1  \nAadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards. \n \nTherefore, all banks are advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same \n \napplies \nfor \nnon-loanee \nfarmers \nenrolled \nthrough \nbanks/Insurance \ncompanies/insurance \n \nintermediaries. \n6.3.2  \nFarmers not having Aadhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for \n \nAadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February, \n \n2017 issued by GOI under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other \n \nSubsidies, Benefits and Services). Copy of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in. This \n \nmay be  subject to further directions issued by Govt. from time to time. \n6.3.3 \n \nAll banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification \nunder  Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage \n \nof loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the \n \nconcerned bank branch regularly. \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n7 \n7. \n Notification \n7.1 \n \nProcedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs: \n7.1.1 \n Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous \n year, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of \n bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the \nScheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT Govt. should ensure the issuance of the notification and \nits circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of \nthe commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, \nareas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops, \nperiod of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt. \nsubsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be \nissued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year  \n7.1.2 \nIn order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the \ndetails as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State \nNotification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tender document shall \nbe allowed post tendering. \n7.1.3 \nBidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on \nNational Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at \nnotified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template \nand should be made part of the Tender.  \n7.1.4 \nCalculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified \ncrops in each district during last year/season. However, in absence of insured area of last year/season \nfor all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of \nweighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only. \n7.1.5 \nBidding shall be done through e-tendering and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the \nopening of the Tender. \n7.1.6 \nDepending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in \ndistrict(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by \nbidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on \npremium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding \nperiod. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as \na general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial \npremium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and name of such crop should be disclosed by State \nGovt. compulsorily in the tender document. \n7.1.7 \nIn such cases where a ceiling has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step \nbidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is for disclosing the premium rate offered by \neach participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorised under “Ceiling \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n8 \nPremium Rate” and  2nd  bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all crops included in \ntender. Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the \nbidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies \nhave to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above. \n7.1.8 \nState Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each \nindividual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the \ncrop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating \nInsurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by \nthe State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered \nfor left out/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after \ndecision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating \nInsurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed \ncrop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate” \nfrom the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all \ncrops/remaining crops. \n7.1.9 \nStates should avoid doing re-tendering as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in \nexceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI after submission of a request with \ndetailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the \nrequest.  \n7.1.10 \nStates are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums, \nrequisite data and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster \ncommunication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also \nbe uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation. \n7.1.11  \nAll conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself \n \nand no new condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any \n \nTender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a \n \ncopy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender  \n7.1.12  \nL1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1 \n \nbidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment  of \n \nwork to others, due to increase in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall  be \n \nrecovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder. \n7.2 \n \nNotification of  Crops,  Areas and Implementing Agency (IA) \n7.2.1 \nThe Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called \nInsurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in \naccordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village \nPanchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for major crops defined at District / \nTaluka or equivalent level. For other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village \nPanchayat. For defining a crop as a major crop for deciding the Insurance Unit level, the sown area of \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n9 \nthat crop should be at least 25% of Gross Cropped Area in a District/  Taluka or equivalent level \n7.2.2 \nFor the claims arising out of crop damage due to post-harvest  losses and localized risks, assessment of \ndamage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in (Section 21, para 21.4 and 21.5 \nrespectively). \n7.2.3 \nSLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based \non CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 7 years for calculation of threshold yield), cropped \nacreage and capacity for estimating yield during proposed season, etc. State govt. should endeavour to \ncover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State. States should ensure that a standard \nmethodology of yield estimation exists for all the crops proposed to be notified \n7.2.4 \nState Govt./ UT should provide 10 years’ historical yield data in soft format(in Excel) in English  to \nInsurance Companies for calculation of threshold yield , premium rates etc. at insurance unit area \nand in its absence, data at next higher unit/nearest neighbouring unit/weighted average of contiguous \nunits, as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified area of insurance unit \nmust be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.  \n7.2.5 \nIn case State Govts/UT proposes to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas under a crop separately, \nthey shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops \nseparately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made \navailable separately for both \n7.2.6 \nWhile notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such \nas in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State Nodal Department to use the \nrelevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while \nreleasing the Tender Document and submission of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible \nclaims. Insurance Companies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document. \nInformation/data provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in case of any error/ \nmisreporting/disparity, State Govt. and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of \nadditional claims arising on account of it, if any. \n7.2.7 \nFor the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the States, if required, can \nnotify additional IUs or de-notify  certain IUs  subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already notified \nIUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of \npremium. If the  deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be \nworked out either by calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous \ndistricts  or  by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will \nbe determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs. \n7.2.8 \nStates implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for \n50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved \ntechnology from GOI. Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement. The data source for \ncalculation of admissibility of incremental CCEs will be the National Crop Insurance Portal. \n  \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n10 \n7.3 \nNotification of Indemnity Level, Average Yield and Threshold Yield \n7.3.1 \nThree levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90%. SLCCCI in consultation with Insurance Companies \nshall approve indemnity levels for notified crops at district level. Threshold Yield (TY) shall be notified \nin the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season.\n The Average Yield of a notified crop in Insurance Unit (IU) will be average yield of best five years out of \nlast seven years. The Threshold yield of the notified crop is equal to Average Yield multiplied by \nIndemnity level. The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU shall compulsorily be part of the notification \nfor the season and shall not change at any point during that season.  \n7.3.2 \nCalculation and Notification of Threshold Yield: For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average \nyield of best five out of last seven years shall be considered. Further Threshold Yield should be defined \nonly at notified area level and once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be \nchanged at later stage under any circumstances. In case of multi-year contract, the Threshold Yield for \nthe subsequent years shall be revised by adding/considering the yields of immediate previous \ncorresponding season. The revised TY and Sum Insured (if revised) should be notified accordingly at \nthe beginning of each crop season in case of multi-year tender.  \n7.4 \nNotification of Seasonality discipline: \n7.4.1 \nState Govt./ UT  in accordance  with the broad seasonality defined/prescribed in the Operational \nGuidelines shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz. \nsubmission of insurance proposals/application, consolidated declarations by banks, remittance of \npremium to Insurance Companies, uploading of individual covered farmer’s data on National Crop \nInsurance Portal, submission of yield data, claim assessment of losses for(i) standing crop(ii) localized \ncalamities,(iii) prevented sowing, iv) post harvest losses, (v) On-Account payment for major calamities, \netc as per the provisions of the Scheme. \n \n*In exceptional cases, where last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of\n \nBidding/Notification, yield data is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However \n \nthe yield data upto last to last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself. \n \nHowever, in such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the basis of yield data of last 7 \n \nyears only. \n7.5 \n Notification of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) \n7.5.1  \nOnly those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which \nare as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/any agency to be \nnotified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real \ntime  weather data.  AWS/ARG   of private agencies should only be considered in absence of properly \nfunctioning AWS/ARGs of IMD/ State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be \ntransferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data \non the Portal will be circulated separately.  \n7.5.2  \nState govt can explore the possibility to create dense AWS/ARG network on PPP Mode for which GOI \nwill provide 50% of the viability gap funding. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n11 \n \n7.5.3  \nThe following data sources may be used for validation of on account   claims and claims for prevented \nsowing:  \n• Satellite/UAV Remote  Sensing Data \n• AWS/ARG Data \n• MNCFC Report/Study on drought assessment \n7.5.4  \nState Govt. shall notify concerned weather data provider/ expert agency whose report/ methodology \n \nwould be used in assessing the extent of losses and computation of claims. Cost of such weather data \n \nshall be borne by the concerned Insurance Companies. The notified AWS and ARG should fulfil/ meet \n \nthe standards/ norms/ criteria specified by the concerned authorities from time to time. \n8. \n Engagement of Common Service Centres (CSCs) and Intermediaries \nfor coverage of Non-Loanee Farmers: \n8.1 \n \nCSCs under Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY) have been engaged to enrol \n \nnon-loanee farmers. The Insurance Companies are required to enter into a separate agreement with \n \nCSC and pay service charges as fixed by DAC&FW, GOI per farmer per village per season. No other \n \nagreement or payment is required to be made for this purpose. Nodal agency for engagement with \n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Insurance Companies will be CSC-SPV, a company \n \nestablished under MeITY for carrying out e-governance initiatives of GoI. \n8.2 \n \nNo charges/fee shall be borne or paid by the farmers being enrolled through CSCs i.e. CSC-SPV and \n \nCSC-VLE \n8.3 \n \nAs per IRDA circular, no separate qualification/certification will be required for the VLEs of CSCs to \n \nfacilitate enrolment of non-loanee farmers. \n8.4 \n \nAll empanelled Insurance Companies will compulsorily be required to enter into an agreement with \n \nCSC for enrolment of non-loanee farmers and for provision of other defined services to farmers.  \n8.5 \n \nOther designated intermediaries may be linked with the Portal in due course.  \n8.6 \n \nEmpanelled Insurance Companies have to necessarily register on the portal and submit list and details \n \nof agents/intermediaries engaged for enrolment of non-loanee farmers in the beginning of each \n \nseason  within 10 days of award of work in the State.  Further all agents/intermediaries have to work \n \nstrictly as per the provisions of the Scheme and IRDA regulations \n9. \n Electronic Remittance of Funds \n9.1 \n \nGovt. of India and State Govt. will endeavour to utilize Public Financial Management System \n \n(PFMS)/PFMS linked systems to remit the funds to State Govt/agencies \n9.2 \nBanks, CSC and Insurance Agents are required to remit the premium payment to respective Insurance \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n12 \nCompany mandatorily through Payment gateway (Pay-Gov) of National Crop Insurance Portal or \nthrough RTGS/NEFT followed by mandatory uploading of payment details on National Crop Insurance \nPortal within stipulated date. Bank details of Insurance Companies shall be made available on National \nCrop Insurance Portal itself. Accordingly, all Stakeholders including Insurance Companies, Bank \nbranches, CSC and Insurance Agents must compulsorily maintain dedicated bank accounts for this \npurpose. No remittance/financial transaction in the form of Banker’s cheque/Demand Draft will be \nallowed. \n9.3 \nInsurance companies will be provided login access to the essential crop notification data/information \nalong with farmer level coverage data including banking details of individual farmers on the National \nCrop Insurance Portal to reconcile, verify, validate and calculate payable claims and remit  the same \ndirectly into pre-declared bank accounts linked to the National Crop Insurance Portal. \n10. \n Census Code Mapping of Entities; \n10.1 \n All States shall map census codes of their villages with the higher administrative/revenue units like \nGram Panchayat, Firkas, Patwar Circles, Revenue Circles, Hoblis, Mandals, Blocks, Tehsils,  Talukas, \nDistricts and Automatic Weather Stations/Backup Weather Stations. This will create a standard \nmechanism of mapping and identification across the country.   \n10.2 \n Further, for purposes of obtaining accurate location, State Govts. must also provide geo coded  \n(latitude. & longitude) village maps on digital format for integration with other Apps like CCEs Agri \nApp, Loss reporting/Assessment App etc. \n11. \n Digitization of Land Records \n11.1 \n State Govts. are advised to digitize their revenue records using village Census codes so that the \nindividual land records of farmers can be accessed through the National Crop Insurance Portal for crop \ninsurance. This will help the Govt. to reach and identify individual beneficiaries and bring utmost \ntransparency and authenticity in benefit transfer. \n12. \n Sum Insured /Coverage Limit \n12.1 \n Sum Insured per hectare for both loanee and non-loanee farmers will be same and equal to the Scale \nof Finance as decided by the DLTC/SLTC, and would be pre-declared by SLCCCI and notified. No other \ncalculation of Scale of Finance will be applicable. Sum Insured for individual farmer is equal to the SOF \nper hectare multiplied by area of the notified crop proposed by the farmer for insurance. Area under \ncultivation shall always be expressed in hectare’. \n12.2 \n In cases where crops are separately notified under irrigated, un-irrigated category by State Govts. Sum \ninsured for irrigated and un-irrigated areas should be separately indicated. \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n13 \n13. \n Premium Rates and Premium Subsidy \n13.1  \nThe Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) would be charged under PMFBY by implementing Insurance \n \nCompany. The rate of premium payable by the farmer will be as per the following Table 1: \nSeason \nCrops \nMaximum Premium payable by farmer (% of \nSum Insured)* \nKharif \nAll food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \nPulses and Oilseeds crops) \n2.0% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \nRabi \nAll food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \nPulses and oilseeds) \n1.5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \nKharif and \nRabi \nAnnual Commercial/ Annual Horticultural crops \n5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \nPerennial horticultural crops (pilot basis) \n5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \n \n* Premium paid by non loanee farmers should be rounded off in Rupee terms \n13.2 \n Payment of Govt. Subsidy: \n13.2.1  \nThe difference between Actuarial Premium Rate and the rate of Insurance premium payable by \n \nfarmers shall be treated as Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally by the \n \nCentre and State Govts. However, the State/ UT Govts. are free to extend additional subsidy over and \n \nabove the normal subsidy from its budget. In other words, additional subsidy, if any shall be borne \n \nentirely by the State/ UT Govt. Subsidy in premium is allowed only to the extent of Sum Insured. \n13.2.2  \nGovt. premium subsidy to the Private empanelled Insurance Companies may be routed  through \n \nAgricultural Insurance Company (AIC) or any agency designated by GOI strictly as per the \n \nguidelines/order of the Govt. This may be reviewed later by Central Govt. and changed  accordingly if \n \nnecessary. Accordingly, AIC/ other designated agency is empowered to call/ collect all requisite \n \ninformation related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Govt. funds and to share \n \nthe same with the Govt for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. The \n \npremium subsidy will be routed through PFMS/PFMS linked systems strictly based on the MIS \n \ngenerated through National Crop Insurance Portal. \n13.2.3  \nGovt, both Centre and State,  will  release their share of advance subsidy (First Instalment) equivalent \n \nto 50% of 80% of their respective share of subsidy in corresponding previous season subject to \n \nfulfilment of General Financial Rule(GFR)/guidelines in the matter without waiting for coverage \n \ndetails  for the ongoing  season. \n13.2.4  \nTo facilitate settlement of prevented risk/ mid season adversity/localized claims: ICs should release the \n \nadmissible claim amount to the beneficiary immediately after receipt of farmers premium and \n \nadvance subsidy (1st Instalment) and without waiting for release of final subsidy (Second Instalment) \n \nfrom  \nGovt. The  premium in  respect of affected IUs including subsidy to enable settlement of \n \nclaims arising due to above events in respect of all such beneficiaries shall be adjusted from the fund \n \nalready  available with ICs as advance upfront subsidy (First Instalment) to facilitate compliance of \n \nSection 64 B  of Insurance Act/Regulation of IRDAI \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n14 \n13.2.5  \nAll admissible claims based on Yield data/Post harvest losses will be settled on receipt of second \n \ninstallment of Govt. subsidy to be paid on the basis of tentative business statistics generated on the \n \nportal after 15 days of period specified for auto approval of applications on the Portal. The remaining \n \nGovt. subsidy, if any will be paid after reconciliation of all business statistics for the season on portal. \n13.2.6  \nAll empanelled insurance companies including private insurance companies shall provide free access \n \nto the Central/State level agencies including CAG authorized to verify the accounts and audit in \n \nrespect of Crop Insurance. \n13.2.7  \nIn case, the State Govt. subsidizes full farmers’ share of premium, in that case a token amount of at \n \nleast Re. 1 should compulsorily be charged from the farmer to facilitate electronic tracking. \n13.2.8  \nState Govt. has to release the State share of premium subsidy within 3 months from premium \n \nrequisition by concerned Insurance Company failing which 1% interest per month shall be levied as \n \npenalty on the State govt. \n13.3 \n Payment of Claim Liabilities: \n13.3.1 \n Insurance company shall take all necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their \nportfolio in order to safeguard insured’s interest. In case premium to claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or \npercentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a crop \nseason, then Govt. will provide protection to Insurance Companies. The losses exceeding the above \nmentioned level in the crop season would be met from equal contribution of the Central Govt. and the \nconcerned State/UT Govts. In case losses are below the above mentioned condition, insurers shall be \nresponsible to settle the admissible claims. \n14. \n Budget for Administrative Expenses \n14.1   \nAt least 2% of the total budget for PMFBY shall be earmarked by State/UTs for administrative \n \nexpenses, publicity, yield/loss assessment expenses, purchase of smart phones, adoption of new \n \ntechnology, setting up of State Technical Support Unit (STSU), travelling and contingency fund.  \n14.2 \nGovt. of India has already made provisions for separate allocations under sub heads like Salaries, \nDomestic Travel Expenses, Technology interventions, Office Expenses, other Administrative Expenses \nand Professional Services etc. for Crop Insurance program under PMFBY/RWBCIS. States should make \nprovisions and  budgetary allocation on similar lines including subhead for incremental cost of CCEs. \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n15 \n15. \n Technical Support Unit (TSU)/ CPMU \n15.1 \n National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) or Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) will be created \nat the Central level at the earliest to provide support and advise on risk classification & rating, \ndevelopment of new products, methodology for loss assessment, legal works, workshop/training & \ncapacity building, alongwith use of technology including innovation/ replication, digitisation of \nadministration of Schemes through Crop Insurance Portal etc.  \n15.2 \n NTSU shall calculate Loss Cost (LC) i.e. Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of \nnotified crop(s) in notified unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/ \nRabi) along with approximate actuarial premium rate of the crops proposed to be notified for the \nseason. This loss cost/premium rate shall be based on the latest available yield data in month of \nJanuary for Kharif crops and July for Rabi crops and shall be provided to DAC & FW/ Concerned States \non request before invitation for premium bidding. This calculation to be done by NTSU on behalf of \nDAC & FW is only for official purposes to have information on the approximate cost to the IA for \ncovering the risks so as to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.  \n15.3 \n National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) may also develop a suitable methodology for risk \nclassification/premium rating by using historical yield data, weather data, use and level of \ninputs/irrigation/technology in crop cultivation, remote sensing data/information etc. for \nstandardization of methodology for risk perception and premium rating for crop insurance in the \ncountry. \n15.4 \n In addition to National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) / Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) \nat Central level, all States/UTs implementing Schemes should also create a separate TSU/PMU at State \nHQ level with sufficient technical experts/staff to ensure proper implementation of the Scheme.  State \nTSU (STSU) may also opt for members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other \norganizations/research institutes etc as deemed fit. However, States shall have to allocate a separate \nbudget for running the STSU. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n16 \n16. \n Seasonality Discipline \n16.1 \n The cut-off date is uniform for both loanee and non-loanee cultivators. The State-wise cut-off dates for \n different crops shall be based on Crop Calendar of major crops published from time to time by the \nDirectorate of Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW,GOI. The latest copy of the Crop Calendar (District \nWise, Crop Wise) is available on www.pmfby.gov.in. The SLCCCI, shall besides considering the \nprevailing agro-climatic conditions, rainfall distribution/ availability of water for irrigation, sowing \npattern etc. in consultation with the Insurance Company fix seasonality discipline of the coverage and \nother activities in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards.  If this is \nviolated by SLCCCI, GOI may decide not to provide premium subsidy. \n16.2 \n The broad indicative seasonality discipline is given in the Table 2 below: \nS.No \nActivity \nKharif \nRabi

due to strikes/shut-down etc., the next working day will be treated as the cut-off \ndate. Concerned States have to take decision in this regard suo moto. For this State Govts should send \na formal intimation to GoI. \n16.4 \n In case of disruption of services due to natural events beyond human control or \ntechnical/software/network issues with the National Crop Insurance Portal the subsequent dates \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n20 \n(other than the cut-off dates for Enrolment/Premium Debit/Collection) may be extended by the \ncompetent authority on the basis of specific written inputs from Portal Development and Maintenance \nAgency. However due care has to be taken that such extension does not lead to moral hazard and \nmisuse of the Scheme and suitable measures should be put forth for the same accordingly. \n16.5 \n Further, in case of three crops / season pattern, a modified seasonality discipline keeping in view the \noverall seasonality discipline prescribed above, shall be adopted by SLCCCI. \n16.6 \n Keeping in view the specific nature of crop and scope for catastrophic crop damage, SLCCCI shall fix \nseasonality in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also \nensure early payment of claims to eligible insured farmers. Scheme also has provisions for claims \ndue to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop. Hence, State Govt. will take all \nnecessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the Scheme. \nNo request/relaxation for extension in the above seasonality/cut-off dates shall be considered/ \ngranted by GoI once it is fixed and notified for the crop season. However, preponement in cut off dates \nshall be considered on case to case basis. If any State/ UT extends the above seasonality/ cut off dates \non their-own, then Central share of premium subsidy shall not be provided for the concerned notified \ncrops /areas. \n16.7 \n It may be noted that, under no circumstance, will DAC&FW or any State/UT Govt.   extend the cut-\noff dates for enrolment of farmers. However, in case the States/UT decide to do so, it may be done only \nin agreement with implementing Insurance Company. In such cases, however no central premium \nsubsidy will be provided for the areas/farmers/crops which are covered/ insured in the extended \nperiod and the concerned State has to bear the entire subsidy liability for the coverage in the \nextended period. \n16.8 \n In a situation where total claims have been approved/auto approved, the company shall be liable to \npay claims within 2 weeks of calculation/auto approval of claims irrespective of whether Insurance \nCompanies have raised the bill for 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy or not. Hence, it is binding on the \nInsurance Company to seek the 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy within the timelines. \n16.9 \n All admissible claims shall mandatorily be paid within the stipulated cutoff date failing which penal \ninterest @ 12% per annum shall be payable on admissible pending claims beyond 30 days of uploading \nAY on portal/provided in soft copy by State Govt. subject to release of applicable subsidy by State \nGovt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n21 \n17. \n Collection of Proposals and Premium from Farmers \n17.1 \n The Nodal Bank system adopted under NAIS/ NCIP* wherein the implementing Insurance Company is \nnot required to deal with all the loan disbursing points and instead deals only with designated Nodal \nbanks, will continue under PMFBY only for Cooperative Banks , However, for Commercial Banks/RRBs, \nthe individual bank branches shall act as Nodal branch for this purpose. The concerned Lead bank and \nRegional offices/ Administrative offices of Commercial banks/RRBs will provide necessary guidelines to \nconcerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches \ncompulsorily remit the farmers premium electronically through NEFT/RTGS to be routed through NCIP \nto concerned  Insurance Companies and submit the consolidated proposals/information in prescribed \nformat  well within the stipulated cut-off dates and also upload the details of individual \ncovered/insured farmers  on National Crop Insurance  Portal. Besides, for the coverage of non-loanee \nfarmers only, Insurance Company may also use IRDAI approved micro insurance agents/ insurance \nintermediaries. However, details of such agents should compulsorily be submitted to State Govt. and \nGovt. of India well before the start of the season for creating their credentials and subsequent \nuploading of details of individual insured/covered farmers on Portal within stipulated timelines.  \n17.2 \n Consolidated declaration/ proposal formats to be submitted physically/ electronically by Nodal \nbanks/Branches shall contain details about Insurance Unit, sum insured per unit, premium per unit, \ntotal area insured of the farmers, number and category of farmers covered (small and marginal or \nother)and number of farmers under other categories(SC/ST/others)/Women along with their bank \naccount details etc.(bank/their branches) as per the application form provided on the National Crop \nInsurance Portal. Banks are required to upload the insured farmers’ data mandatorily on the National \nCrop Insurance Portal. No other platform shall be used for uploading/submission of farmers’ data. \nThose farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall only be eligible for \nInsurance coverage and accordingly the premium subsidy will also be released. In cases where farmers   \nare denied crop insurance due to incorrect/ partial/non-uploading of their details on Portal, concerned \nBanks/Intermediaries shall be responsible for payment of claims to them \n17.3 \n In order to facilitate timely release of Govt. subsidy and remittance of claims to the farmers. entry \nof detailed information of all insured farmers on NCIP is essential  for all bank branches/PACS/ \nCSCs/Intermediaries/designated insurance agents and Insurance Companies  \n17.4 \n Loanee farmers (Compulsory coverage) \n17.4.1 \nWhenever banks sanction loan for a notified crop in a notified area, the crop loan amount to the \nextent of notified Sum Insured (equivalent to DLTC/SLTC approved Scale of Finance) for notified \ncrop and acreage of individual notified crop of loanee farmer shall be taken into consideration for \ncompulsory coverage, as per seasonality discipline. Based on seasonality of crop, banks should \nseparately calculate the eligibility of loan amount for both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the Scale \nof Finance and declared acreage under notified crops. Disbursing bank branch/ PACS will prepare \nstatement of crop-wise and insurance unit-wise details of crop insurance with premium as per the \nseasonality discipline. Loan disbursing bank branch/ PACS shall finance additional loan equal to the \npremium amount payable by farmer for crop insurance. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n22 \n17.4.2 \nFor insurance coverage of a farmer, SI amount for a notified crop will be equivalent to Scale of Finance \ndefined in the Govt. notification and uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal for the \nconcerned notified crop and season. The total Sum Insured of loanee farmer for the season shall be \ncalculated accordingly. The compulsory coverage shall solely be based on the sanctioned / renewal of \ncredit limit for notified crop for the season only and will be independent of disbursed \namount/withdrawals. Farmers availing/renewing the KCC loans for Kharif & Rabi crops after cut-off \ndate (renew/sanction period) for the season will be eligible for cover under crop insurance for the \nnext/following crop season subject to the loan being standard loan and cut-off-date of premium debit \nfor the season. In order to eliminate excess insurance and subsequent application of Area Correction \nFactor(ACF), care should be taken by the banks to ensure that only correct acreage under each \ndeclared crop in loan application is considered for compulsory coverage of notified crop and not the \nactual total acreage,. Banks will be liable for audit and inspection on account of excess Insurance/ACF. \n17.4.3 \nBenefit of add on products viz., prevented sowing/ on account payment for Mid season adversity/ \nlocalized calamity will be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium / the premium \nhas been debited from their account before the damage notification by the State Govt. for invoking \nthis provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure that they debit farmers premium within 15 \ndays from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim \nliabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium \nat least one month before cut-off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction \nhappens within one month of cut-off date, banks may daily debit premium for such accounts. \n17.4.4 \nDetailed example for Calculation of crop-wise Sum Insured for the season for compulsory coverage is \ngiven in Table 3 below:   \n  \nCrop 1 \nCrop 2 \nCrop 3 \nCrop 4 \nCrop 5 \nCrop 6 \nTotal Land Ownership (Ha) \n8 \nKharif \nRabi \nName of Crop \nPaddy \nMaize \nCotton \nWheat \nPotato \nGram \nActual Sown Area (Ha) under the crop \n5 \n2 \n1 \n6 \n1 \n1 \nArea (Ha) declared in KCC application \n2 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n1 \n1 \nCrop Season \nKharif \nRabi \nScale of Finance (Rs./Ha) \n50,000 \n40,000 \n60,000 \n50,000 \n70,000 \n30,000 \nTotal Sanctioned Sub limit for crop cultivation \n1,00,000 \n40,000 \n60000 \n1,00,000 \n70,000 \n30,000 \nSeason-wise sub limit for crop cultivation \n2,00,000 \n2,00,000 \nAdditional loan amount for consumption and \nmaintenance of machinery etc (max.

It shall be the responsibility of ICs to collect the consolidated statement from the \nconcerned bank branches/ PACS. \n17.4.7 \n Different options are available for bank branches to provide details of beneficiaries in a more \ntransparent and authentic mechanism. Bank branch can upload the details of insured farmers through \nonline application mode. Banks are required to upload/enter the information continuously without \nwaiting for last day for premium debit and data entry. \n17.4.8 \n As an alternative, direct integration of Core Banking Solution (CBS) with National Crop Insurance Portal \nhas also been successfully initiated and the same may be used by Scheduled Commercial \nBanks/RRBs/DCCBs available on CBS for pushing the farmers’ details in bulk directly without filling the \nindividual farmer’s details on web-portal or off-line utility.   \n17.5  \nNon-loanee farmers (Optional coverage) through other channel partners \n17.5.1 \n Farmers desirous of availing insurance shall fill up Application Form of the Scheme and submit the \nsame to nearest bank branch/CSCs or authorized channel partner or insurance intermediaries of \ninsurance company. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n24 \n17.5.2 \nIn case of submission through Bank Branches, farmers will submit duly filled proposal form in the \nnearest branch of a Commercial Bank (CB) or Regional Rural Bank (RRB), or PACS (DCCB) with applicable \ninsurance premium amount and other documents.

Premium is accepted by the bank branch preferably from \nthe farmer’s operational account in the same bank branch itself and the same would be sent to the \nconcerned Insurance Company within the stipulated time for the purpose. It is the responsibility of \nbank branch to complete the application of farmer. In case the farmers is unable to fill the \napplication, bank branch is responsible for filling the application on farmer’s behalf, so that not a \nsingle farmer who desires to take crop insurance coverage is left out from the purview of crop \ninsurance Scheme \n17.5.3 \nIn case submitted through CSCs, farmer will be required to authenticate herself/himself using Aadhaar \nfor filling up online application form. Having a bank account is essential for such cases. CSC will upload \nall requisite/desired supporting documents on Portal while filling up the application form on behalf of \nthe farmer. Applications without requisite documents would not be considered for insurance coverage \nand CSC-VLE is responsible for proper filling of application form. \n17.5.4 \nCSC/Branch/ PACS officials will assist the farmers in completing the insurance proposal form and \nprovide necessary guidance. While accepting the applications and premium, CSC/Branch/ PACS will be \nresponsible for verification of required documents, eligible sum insured, applicable premium rate, etc. \nIn case of coverage through PACS, they will consolidate these particulars and send them directly/ to \nrespective Nodal Bank Branches which will, in turn, submit application details online on National Crop \nInsurance Portal and submit crop-wise and insurance unit-wise declarations electronically in the \nprescribed format, along with the e-remittance of premium using payment gateway/ RTGS/NEFT \nmode, within the stipulated time, to insurance company.  Besides CSCs, other Govt./ semi-Govt. \ninstitutions/organizations including Post offices are also proposed to be utilized for insurance of non-\nloanee farmers after  their integration with the National Crop Insurance Portal after  obtaining \napproval of competent authorities. \n17.5.5 \nNon-loanee cultivators could also be serviced directly by any designated agencies, other authorized \nchannel partners or insurance intermediaries, approved by the IRDA for the purpose and they will act \nas a guide and facilitator wherein they will advise such non loanee cultivators about the benefits and \ndesirability of the Scheme and guide the farmers  about procedures; collect requisite premium and \nremit individual/ consolidated premium electronically to insurance company, accompanied by individual \nproposal forms and summary details in declaration form  and upload details of each insured \nfarmer compulsorily within stipulated timelines on the NCIP. \n17.5.6 \nWhile accepting the Proposal and the premium from aforesaid designated agents, other authorized \nchannel partner or insurance intermediaries approved by IRDA, it shall be the responsibility of \nInsurance Company or its designated agents to verify insurable interest and collect the land records, \nAadhaar Number., particulars of acreage, sum insured, crop sown etc. and applicable contract/ \nagreement details in case of share croppers/ tenant farmers.

Yield data so arrived at will be approved/ uploaded by \n \nthe concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.  \n18.2  \nCCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance  for notified crops*,on a sliding scale, as \n \nindicated in Table 4 below: \nSl. \nNo. \nLevel \nMinimum sample size \n1 \nDistrict \n24 \n2 \nTaluka/Tehsil/Block \n16 \n3 \nMandal/Firka/Revenue Circle/Hobli or any other equivalent unit \n10 \n4 \nVillage/Village Panchayat \n4 \n \n \n* Minor crops may be notified at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level. \n18.3  \nIn order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the \n \nmodalities mentioned below will be followed: \n18.3.1 \n To bring better transparency and confidence in the data, States shall mandatorily ensure 100% CCEs \nthrough a mobile application specially designed by Govt. of India for this purpose. No other application \nshall be used for conducting CCEs. CCE plots for conducting CCEs shall be chosen through random \nselection or preferably using RST and secrecy of the selected plot should be maintained until the CCE \nis actually conducted in order to rule out moral hazards. \n18.3.2 \n In order to provide proper benefits to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss \nexperience, crop should be notified at lowest level i.e. Village/Village Panchayat \n18.3.3 \n State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balances. Digitizing \nthe CCE process including geo-coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ \ntime- stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs(para \n20.4) \n18.3.4 \n Wherever external agencies are proposed to be used by the State Govts. for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs \nare out-sourced), it should be given only to the registered ‘professional/accredited’ agencies with \nadequate experience in agricultural field activities/yield estimation. It is mandatory for these agencies \nto follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may \nalso be utilized for assessment of Post-harvest loss and losses due to localized risks. \n18.3.5 \n States shall maintain same procedure and methodology for conducting CCEs as adopted by NSSO or \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n29 \nState Manual for Crop Production estimation  \n18.3.6 \n District level Steering Committee: State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in \neach district to plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of \nyield data to the State Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by District level \nHead of Department/Organisation responsible for conducting CCEs. District Agriculture/Cooperative \nofficers, representatives of SSO and Insurance Companies shall be members. The Steering committee \nwill compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies so that they shall be well \ninformed about each and every activity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning, \nschedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and \nindividual CCE result etc. Head of Steering Committee wil be responsible for uploading of all requisite \ninformation on National Crop Insurance Portal i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and \nimparting training to field functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will \ncompulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State. \nConcerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of \nhead of Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and \nobtaining the information of CCEs etc. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics \nat the office for the insurance company official. \n18.3.7 \n In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non-availability of \nadequate cropped area, adverse weather conditions/inadequate infrastructure etc. the yield estimate \nfor such IUs can be generated by using methods such as (i) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, \nor (ii) adopting the yield of a neighbouring IU with maximum correlation. Priority of applicability of \naforesaid two methods should be notified by the concerned States in the notification itself, failing \nwhich option of yield estimate of next higher unit only would be considered. However, this clause shall \nonly be applicable in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units \nand cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs.  Special efforts should be made by the State to \nconduct adequate no. CCEs in all notified units in order to provide appropriate benefits to farmers.  \n18.3.8 \n In case of multi-picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) & \nother crops of similar nature, following procedure shall be followed. \n18.3.8.1 \n State needs to, in the beginning; specify the number of required picking for each crop both for \nirrigated and un-irrigated conditions. Ideally it should be as per NSSO/IASRI defined guidelines, if it is \nnot available, State in consultation with local Agriculture Universities and concerned ICAR center may \nidentify the required number of pickings. However number of actual picking depends on climatic \nconditions etc. Hence possibility of further pickings of each picking should compulsorily be recorded in \nCCE app and no. of actual picking will be final in such cases. \n18.3.8.2 \nIf the required number of CCEs have been done and the required number of picking have not being \ndone, then for those experiments, factors need to be used to extrapolate yield to the final yield. \n18.3.8.3 \nThe factors (proportion of picking wise yield) need to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with \nthe required number of pickings) from the same Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un-irrigated \ncondition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.   \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n30 \nAn Example for Yield Calculation for multi-picking crop is mentioned in Table 5 below: \nCrop \nExperiment no. \nPicking 1 \nYield \n(Kg)  \nPicking 2 \nYield  \n(Kg) \nPicking 3 \nYield (Kg)  \nPicking 4 \nYield \n(Kg)  \nTotal Yield Kg) \nP1 \n P2 \nP3 \nP4 \n∑P1,P2,P3,P4 \nWell Conducted CCEs in the  Taluka with 4 pickings \nCotton \nE1 \n1 \n1.95 \n2.1 \n1.25 \n6.3 \nCotton \nE2 \n1 \n2 \n1.75 \n1.4 \n6.15 \nCotton \nE3 \n0.75 \n1.75 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n5.5 \nCotton \nE4 \n0.8 \n1.43 \n2.15 \n1.4 \n5.78 \nCotton \nE5 \n0.95 \n1.85 \n1.4 \n0.75 \n4.95 \n  \nAverage \n0.9 \n1.8 \n1.78 \n1.26 \n5.74 \n  \nFactor (Total yield/ \nPicking Yield) \n6.373 \n2.128 \n1.282 \n  \n  \n(1st) \n(1st + \n2nd) \n(1st+ 2nd+3rd \n) \n  \nCCEs with Less Pickings in any IU within that  Taluka \nCotton \nE6 (only 1st Picking) \n1 \n  \n  \n  \n6.373* \nCotton \nE7 (1st and 2nd Picking) \n1.2 \n1.75 \n  \n  \n6.278* \nCotton \nE8 (1st, 2nd & 3rd  Picking) \n1.1 \n1.85 \n1.57 \n  \n5.795* \n* \nTotal yield has been calculated as the sum of the available picking yields multiplied by \nthe corresponding factor \n18.3.8.4 \nIn cases there is dispute regarding the large deviation in picking dates the average picking dates should \nbe computed from well conducted CCEs in Taluka level. Accordingly the picking dates and number will \nbe adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in \nDecember and one experiment has shown first picking in December it will be considered as second \npicking. \n18.3.8.5 \nIf there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the  Taluka level even, it should be \nconsidered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard \nOperating Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and \nweather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having \nfurther pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile application/ CCE-Agri App while \nconducting the current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for \ncalculation of AY.  \nThe Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through online \nCCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified \nand approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were \nconducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data, along with the location \ninformation shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on \nthe Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed \n5% of total CCEs. Actual Yield data through any other mode other than through National Crop \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n31 \nInsurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within \npre-defined cut-off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned Insurance Company, \nmay inform State Govt. /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action. \n18.3.8.6 \nInsurance Company should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, the digital images of the \nCCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time \nbasis (Para 35.2.11). A schedule should be formally given/ shared with Insurance Companies \nsufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize \ntheir manpower accordingly.  For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one \nrepresentative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper \nday to day liaison (Para 18.3.6).  State shall provide necessary space in the concerned office & facilitate \nsharing of information. \n19. \n Dispute resolution regarding Yield Data/Crop loss \n19.1 \n It has been seen, during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, there are various types of yield \ndisputes, which unnecessarily delays the claim settlement. Following figure shows the procedures to \nbe adopted in various cases. \n \nFigure. Procedures to be followed in different yield dispute cases  \n \n19.2 \n Wherever the yield estimates reported at IU level are abnormally low or high vis-à-vis the general crop \ncondition the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of various products \n(e.g. Satellite based Vegetation Index, Weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including \nstatistical test, crop models etc.) to confirm yield estimates. If Insurance Company witnesses any \nanomaly/deficiency in the actual yield data(partial /consolidated) received from the State Govt., the \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n32 \nsame shall be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of \nreceipt of yield data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and \nanomaly, if any, may be resolved  in next 7 days by the  State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC) \nheaded by Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department. This \ncommittee shall be authorized to decide all such cases and the decision in such cases shall be final. The \nSLCC may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) for dispute resolution \n(Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5). In case the matter stands unresolved even after \nexamination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes \nof meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and SLCC. Reference to TAC can be made \nthereafter only in conditions specified in Para 19.7.1 However, data with anomalies which is not \nreported within 7 days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines \ndefined above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State \ndepartment in batches, i.e. Crop-wise-District-wise lots of data and timelines for each batch of data \nshall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of yield data will attract \npenal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the SLCC in the matter. \n19.3 \n The existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of \nEconomics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI,  will be further augmented and  constituted \nunder the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW and additional  members depending on \ncase to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian \nCouncil of Agriculture Research (ICAR),  Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote \nSensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centre (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO), \nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), \nNational Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD)  \nor any other such organisation. \n19.4 \n The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case, \nthe matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency (as \ndefined in the SOP for yield dispute). Technical Agency (TA) will compulsorily take \ninput/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and \nmay also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of \nchairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP. \n19.5 \n State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to \nresolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned \ndepartment with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state \ncentre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the \nconcerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for \nfurther deliberation/examination and decision. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n33 \n19.6 \n TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions \nbased on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and technical parameters as \ndetailed in the SOP. \n19.7 \n The SOP to deal with yield dispute cases is as under: \n19.7.1  \nWhen to use this SOP: This SOP will be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield \nvalues between the State Government and the Insurance Company and this has not been resolved at \nSLCC level and STAC (Para 19.2) and the matter has been referred to the Central Government \nTechnical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a \nTechnical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following \nconditions are satisfied.  All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their \ndecision shall be final and binding on all concerned. \n• There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the \ninsurance company. \n• There is sufficient documentary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required \nnumber and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the IUs for the particular crop \nin the Cluster.  \n• The matter has  been considered by the SLCC and STAC but could not be resolved at State level. \n• The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State \nGovt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to \nsupport its claim. \n \n19.7.2 \nThe Organizations to which TAC can refer the case to: The organizations can be Central Govt. or \nautonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC \n(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non-government organizations (e.g. \nCCAFS-BISA-CGIAR), as decided by TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical \nAgencies.  \n \n19.7.3 \nData to be provided by State Government:  \n• All CCEs data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs \nand other collateral data, as collected during CCE. The CCE data should be ideally geo referenced.  \n• Village level crop area estimates. \n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at  Taluka/block \nlevel) in digital format, (preferably Excel)  \n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if not \navailable, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, \nrainy days and temperature, in digital format, (preferably Excel) \n• Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rainfall or any \nother natural/ manmade disasters in that area \n• Report of any analysis carried out by the States to support its claim \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n34 \n \n19.7.4 \nData to be provided by Insurance Company:  \n• Data of the co-observed CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital format, (preferably \nExcel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during CCE \n• Data of weather observatories*, if maintained or sourced by Insurance Companies, in the contested \narea \n• Report of the technical studies* carried out by the Insurance Company to support its claim. \n• Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested. \n• Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area \n \n(*This data shall only be considered where prior approval for such agency has been taken from State \nGovt. as outlined in para 2.13) \n  \n19.7.5 \nAnalysis to be carried out by the Technical Agency:  \n \nAmong the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed from a to d and any one step should be \nfollowed from e to f. The steps in g and h are compulsory. \n• Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data: Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range, \nStandard Error, etc.)  Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot, \nWhiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether CCEs were \ndone using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify \nreasons for lower number of CCE. \n• Analysis of Weather Data: Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using \ngridded or satellite based data, Dry-spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis \n(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop \ncondition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be \nstudied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall \ndata or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground \nstations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree \ndata should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather \ndata can also be sourced from weather companies.  \n• Analysis of Long-term Yield Data: Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or  Taluka level) analysis \nshould be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean \nyield, standard deviation, and CV. \n• Analysis of Other collateral data: Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop \nWeather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme  crop reports, drought \nassessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years \n(http://agmarknet.gov.in/), \ncrop \ncondition \ndata \navailable \non \nVEDAS \nplatform \n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather \nbulletins, weather information/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/),   \netc. \n• Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this \npurpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n35 \n(NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health \nIndex (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI),  etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of \nappropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).  \n \n Table 6 : Types of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of \nanalysis \nLevel \nof \nAnalysis \nSpatial \nResolution  \nto be used \nExamples of Satellite/Sensor \nVillage level \n5-10 m or \nbetter \nResourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5 \nm); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m) \nBlock/Tehsil \nlevel  \n10-30 m \nResourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI \n(10 m) \nDistrict level \n50-100 m \nResourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m) \n \nHowever, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should \nnot be used for village level for information.  Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop \nmaps should be overlaid on the data.  Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under \nFASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote \nsensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution.  Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least \nagricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest \n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.  \n• \nCrop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as \nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used \nfor crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated \nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.  \n• \nIdentification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any \nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. \nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or \ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, \nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.  \nWhatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record \ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the \nparticular crop’s yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both \nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, \nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 \nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.  \n• \nComputing Yield for the Outliers: For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield \nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term \nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote \nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n36 \nThe final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The \nweightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or \nModel). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo \nlocation, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if \nmodel is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant \nthe average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may \nhave specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for \nany other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm \nrainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small \namount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall \nhaving calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to \nconsider each of the cases as an individual and special case.  \n \n19.7.6  \nTime required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical \nagency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State \nGovernment. \n \n19.7.7 \nFunds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its \nexisting resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may \nbe funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has \nbrought the dispute issue up to TAC.  \n \n19.7.8 \nGeneral Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long \nrun, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made \nto avoid dispute. \n• The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and \ncollect the data using Smartphone based Android App \n• States need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation \n• States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State \nlevel organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres \nlocated in the State, local IMD office, etc. \n• The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs. \n• The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss \nassessment. \n• There should be better coordination between the State and the Insurance Companies. \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n37 \n20. \n Use   of   Innovative Technologies  \n20.1 \n To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging \ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products. \nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference \nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the \ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target \nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’ \n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them \nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about \n30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it \nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this \ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in \ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For \nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under \nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, \npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to \nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized \ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be \nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop \nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a \nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation \nwith MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such \nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology. \n20.2 \n To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, \narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, \ndigitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed \nprocedure has been laid down in section 25 \n \n20.3 \n For Direct Yield Estimation \n20.3.1 \n For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and \ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real \ntime transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and \ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international \norganizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the \nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various \nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and \nsupport timely claim processing and payments.  \n20.3.2 \n States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out \nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n38 \nabove, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between \nremote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance \nCompanies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the \nsatisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to \nservice the claims. \n20.4 \n To improve Yield-data Quality and Timeliness \n \n20.4.1 \n It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is \nlacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real \ntime, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held \ndevices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on \nNational Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri-app. RST using satellite and drones, weather data, \nmodel etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation \nthrough CCEs. \n20.4.2 \n The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand \nheld devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and State \nGovts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by \nCentral Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones \nand other related costs (RST, Drone, etc). \n20.5 \n Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for \nmeeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt. \nfunds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with excess farmers share of premium surrendered \nby Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on \naccount of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2 \n21. \n Assessment of Claims \n21.1 \n Wide Spread Calamities \n21.1.1 \n If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite \nnumber of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers \ngrowing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in \nyield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency. \n \n‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula: \n    \n  \n \n(Threshold Yield – Actual Yield) \n \n                            ———————————————        X     Sum Insured \n         \n                                                 Threshold Yield \n \nWhere Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years \nfrom past seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n39 \n21.1.2 \n Illustration \n \nIn table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of “X”. \nCalculation of TY for Rabi 2014-15 season is given in Table 7 below: \nYear \n2008-09 \n2009-10 \n2010-11 \n2011-12 \n2012-13 \n2013-14 \n2014-15 \nYield(kg/ha) \n4500 \n3750 \n2000 \n4250 \n1800 \n4300 \n1750 \n \nThe years of 2012-13 and 2014-15 have the lowest yields. \n \nTotal of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is 3550kg/ha \ni.e.(1800+1750). Therefore according to the provision, average of best five years excluding two lowest \nyield years will be (22350–3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% \nof indemnity levels will be 3384kg/ha, 3008kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively. \n21.2 \n On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity \n21.2.1 \n Insurance cover will be provided to the farmers to provide immediate relief in case of adverse \nseasonal conditions during the crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc., \nwherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Normal Yield. \n21.2.2 \n Eligibility Criteria: \n21.2.2.1 \nAll notified IUs would be eligible for “ON ACCOUNT” payment only if the expected Yield of the affected \ncrop during the season is less than 50% of Normal Yield. \n21.2.2.2 \nThe provision could be invoked for a specific crop or group of crops in notified IU, by the State Govt. \nthrough damage notification based on the proxy indicators and depending on fulfilment of laid down \nconditions \n21.2.2.3 \nThe quantum of likely losses and the amount of ‘on-account’ payment shall be decided based on the \njoint survey by Insurance Company and State Govt. officials. \n21.2.2.4 \nOnly those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the \npremium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the \nState Govt. for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks must ensure to debit farmers premium \nwithin 15 days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan to provide benefit of this add on products , \nfailing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible famers.  \n21.2.2.5 \n Amount payable would be 25% of the likely claims, subject to adjustment against final claims.  \n21.2.2.6 \nIf adversity occurs within 15 days before the normal harvest time, this provision will not be invoked. \nThen the losses will not qualify under this provision. \n21.2.3 \n Proxy-Indicators: Indicators to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather data, \nsatellite imagery, drought assessment reports of MNCFC and crop condition reports by district level/ \nState Govt. officials, supported by media report and field photographs. The State’s notification should \nalso spell out all the necessary details in this regard.  \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n40 \n21.2.4 \n Loss assessment procedure: \n21.2.4.1 \nJoint Committee of State Govt. and the Insurer for assessment of crop damage have to be formed and \nnotified before start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district. \n21.2.4.2 \nThis Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for On-Account payment based on the weather data \n(available AWS notified by the Govt.)/long term average rainfall data/satellite imagery supported by \nestimated yield losses at notified IU level. Loss intimation order has to be issued within 7days from the \nadverse seasonal event. \n21.2.4.3 \nBased on the above report, a joint inspection of the affected area maybe done by Insurance Company \nalong with State Govt officials for ground truthing using mobile phone App and arrive at the extent of \nloss. \n21.2.4.4 \nInformation/ Services of MNCFC, ISRO or SRSC may also be utilized for determination of extent of loss, \nusing satellite data,  for On Account payout. \n21.2.4.5 \nIf the expected loss of the affected crop is more than 50% of the normal yield for the Notified \nInsurance Unit, On-Account payment would be payable. \n21.2.4.6 \nOn-Account payment would be calculated as per following formula:  \n \n \n            (Threshold Yield-Estimated Yield) \n \n ———————————————— × Sum Insured ×25% \n                                               Threshold Yield \n21.2.5 \n Timeframe for loss assessment and submission of report: \n21.2.5.1 \nAn order will be issued by Nodal Dept. of State Govt. defining eligibility of On Account  payment with \ndetails of  affected IUs within 7 days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal  event. \n21.2.5.2 \nLoss assessment report at the affected insurance unit level has to be completed by the Joint \nCommittee within 15 days from occurrence of the adverse seasonal event. \n21.2.6 \n Conditions: \n21.2.6.1 \nMere disbursement/ sanction of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notification of \ncalamity would not make a farmer eligible for the claim. \n21.2.6.2 \nThe On-Account payment would be disbursed by the Insurance Company without waiting for the \nreceipt of final share of Govt. subsidy (Second Instalment) \n21.2.6.3 \nOn Account payment would be paid to all eligible insured farmers within one month of the notification \ninvoking this provision by the State Govt. and subject to receipt of loss assessment report from State \nGovt.. \n21.2.6.4 \nThese claims would be adjusted against the end season area approach yield based claims. \n21.2.6.5 \nBank would remit farmers’ premium to Insurance Company, with farmers list, within 7 days of \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n41 \nintimation of loss under this section, if not uploaded earlier on Portal. However, this option must be \nexercised as a last recourse with proper justification.  \n21.2.7 \nIllustration \n21.2.7.1 \nDistrict ‘A’ has been affected by floods having 100 insurance units under Crop ‘X’. Out of which 50 \ninsurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro-met data, it has been \nassessed that 30 IUs could have yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield. Out of these 30 \ninsurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category-I), for another 10 units, it is 70% \n(Category-II) and remaining 15units, it is 60% (Category-III) of normal average yield. As per declarations \nreceived, if sum insured for notified areas in Category-I, Category-II and Category-III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 \ncrore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will be Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, \nrespectively. Hence on-account claims upto 25% shall be Rs.20 lakh, 35 lakh and 45 lakh, which will be \nreleased during the season subject to receipt of premium subsidy. \n21.2.7.2 \nDetailed Procedure and Timelines On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity is \nmentioned in Table 8 below: \nSl \nNo. \nActions required to be taken \nActions to be \ntaken by \nSchedule for taking action \n1 \nFormation of District Level Joint Committee (DL JC)  under \nChairpersonship of DC/DM with the following members for \nloss assessment survey    \n• \nDistrict Agriculture / Horticulture /  Revenue \nOfficer – as Convener, \n• \nConcerned Insurance Company , \n• \nRepresentative of IMD from nearest Observatory, \nif available \n• \nRepresentative of KVK /  Agriculture University \n• \n3 representatives from district farmers nominated \nby Agriculture Department \n• \nDistrict collector may co-opt experts , \n State/ UT \n(SLCCCI) \nIt should be a part of main \nNotification to be issued by State/ \nUT for implementation of PMFBY. \nThe composition of Committee \nshould be notified in the PMFBY \nnotification by the State/UT & first \nmeeting should be held within a \nweek after notification to \nfamiliarize the members with the \nprocedure to be followed. \nDetails of Govt.’s AWS/ARG in Notification to be issued by \nState/ UT for implementation of PMFBY for weather data \nsupply including rainfall to DLJC. \n  \nTo be included in the main \nnotification of State Govt. itself   \nIn case Govt.

Ideally the discrepancy should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers \nwith genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures are being taken by concerned stakeholders for \nde duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and \nproposal/loan application of insured farmers. The details of individual insured farmers are being \ncollected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absence of digitized \nfarm records on a GIS platform and its integration with the Portal, it would be cumbersome to \nphysically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the \nsown areas.  Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which \nis not being included in sowing areas furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of \ncrop the during the season. State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in \nconsultation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.  \n25.2 \n Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of \nactuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant \nclaims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the \nresponsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the \ncrop which farmer actually intend to sow/actually sown.  Option to change the insured crop has also \nbeen provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is \nalso a provision to indemnify the crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of \nindividual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to \nforfeiting of claims, if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.     \n \n25.3 \n Area Discrepancy will be applied only to those major crops for which Normal area sown data at the \nBlock/Taluka level shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring \nthe areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions  and \nshall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal. No other data from any source including \nState Govt. will be considered.  \n25.4 \n However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published \ncultivable area at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW, in writing \nafter cut off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with \nfacts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government \nand rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal  \n25.5 \n Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all. \n25.6 \n If the difference between insured area and sown area provided by MNCFC  is >30% at Block/Tehsil/ \nTaluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be \ntreated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.  \n25.7 \nData on application of ACF shall be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.  \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n58 \n25.8 \n Accordingly excess insured area shall be treated as un-insured and corresponding farmer’s premium \nwill be forfeited and the same will be surrendered to Technology Fund of GOI and may be utilized for \nleveraging technology in PMFBY for improvement of technology/research/Impact assessment etc and \ntowards assistance to States for cost of incremental CCEs  \n25.9 \n Premium subsidy refunded by ICs due to application of ACF shall be refunded to Central/State Govt. in \nration of 50:50   \n26. \n Publicity and Awareness \n26.1 \n Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible \nmeans of electronic and print media, farmer’s fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries \nshall be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme \namong the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/ \nCooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and \npublicity on an on-going basis from three months prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly, \nInsurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work. \nAll the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance \nPortal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc. \n26.2 \n The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity \nbuilding of the associated agents, banks etc for effective implementation of the Scheme and organize \ntraining workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance \nCompanies. \n26.3 \n Insurance company should spend 0.5% of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field \nlevel and the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every \nseason. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall \ndeposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cut off date for enrolment. \n27. \n Service Charges  \n27.1 \nTo Banks \n27.1.1 \nBank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the farmer’s share of \npremium by Insurance Company as generated from the Portal and within the 15 days of finalization of \nbusiness statistics.

However, a National Level \nMonitoring Committee (NLMC) under the chairmanship of Secretary, DAC & FW will monitor the \nScheme at the national level. \n29.2 \n It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop \nseason to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers: \n29.2.1 \n The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both \nloanee and non-loanee) like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number, Aadhaar number village, \ncategories – small and marginal/SC/ST/women, insured acreage, insured crop(s), sum insured, \npremium collected, Govt. subsidy etc and submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration \nmodule along with electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cut-\noff date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to \nthe concerned Insurance Company by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of \nindividual crop. \n29.2.2 \n Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area \ndata but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall \nimmediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final \nreceipt of actual yield data as detailed in section 25. \n29.2.3 \n Insurance Companies shall calculate crop-wise, IU wise payable claims based on the actual yield data \nand threshold yield given at the time of tendering. Accordingly the payable claims subject to payment \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n60 \nof full premium share by the Central and State Govt for the season shall be remitted by the Insurance \nCompanies directly into benefitted farmer’s accounts electronically, payment details for which shall be \nupdated on the National Crop Insurance Portal on daily basis. \n29.2.4 \n After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial \ninstitutions/banks should display the list of the beneficiaries/details of claims (both loanee and non-\nloanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of \nfarmers/beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc.  \n29.2.5 \n The list of beneficiaries (Bank-wise and insured area-wise) shall also be uploaded/ placed on  the \nwebsite of the concerned Insurance Companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public \ngrievance redressal/feed-back etc. State Govts./UT should ensure that crop insurance products \nprovide comprehensive insurance coverage to the farmers on sound insurance principles and provide \nthe best value for the premium. State Govt. may also review the progress of Scheme periodically and \nundertake impact assessment after the completion of each season and send their suggestion/ \nrecommendations to this Department for making further improvements in the Scheme. \n29.2.6 \n About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by Regional Offices/Local level Offices of ICs who will \nsend the feedback to concerned DLMC and State Govt./SLCCCI on Crop Insurance. \n29.2.7 \n At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the IC may be cross verified by the concerned DLMC and \nthey should send the feed back to State Govt. \n29.2.8 \n 1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Office of the IC/Independent Agencies \nappointed by the Central Govt./NLMC and they should send the necessary feed back to Central \nGovernment. \n30. \n Grievance Redressal Mechanism-  \n30.1 \nAt the initial level, for grievance redressal, each district shall designate district level grievance redressal \nofficer preferably District Agri Officer to respond to the grievances of Farmers, Banks, ICs etc. within 7 \ndays of receipt of grievance. In case of dissatisfaction the matter may be brought before District Level \nGrievance Redressal Committee (DGRC)  \n30.2 \n District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC): a district level monitoring Committee shall act \nas a grievance redressal Committee for redressal of grievances of Farmers, Banks, Insurance Company, \nDistrict Authority/Department. This Committee will be headed by District Magistrate/Collector and \nrepresentatives of Farmers, LDM/Banks, DDM NABARD, Insurance Company and concerned District \nAuthority/Department shall be appointed as members.

This Committee may also \ninvite subject specialists/experts from University/IMD/research institutions/commodity Boards/, State \nRemote Sensing Agency, STSU, STAC etc. if deemed necessary. The Committee will dispose the \ngrievance within 15 days time of receipt of grievance. The decision of the Committee shall be accepted \nby all the parties. \n \n31. \n Empanelment and Selection of Insurance Companies \n31.1 \n Empanelment Criteria \n31.1.1 \n The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC \n& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The \nInsurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate \nexperience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC&FW. \nOnce Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as pre-qualified \ncompany to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the \nScheme/Programme of DAC&FW.  \n31.1.2 \n L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines \nafter being declared L1,  it will be de-empanelled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for \nthe coming/next season(s) in the concerned State and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing \nthe crop insurance Scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their \nconsent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for \nwithdrawal/surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further \ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to \nthe State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing \nL1 bidder. \n31.1.3 \n Tender should be  preferably for 3 years and in no case less than  1 year  \n31.1.4 \n Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs \n \n31.2 \n Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA) \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n62 \n31.2.1 \n The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as \nImplementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the \nScheme in their State. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller \nStates, the whole State may be assigned to one IA. \n31.2.2 \n Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre-qualified companies \nas mentioned in the preceding para through open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-\nwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level, \nThreshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The  \nempanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified \n/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid. \n31.2.3 \n Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified \ncompanies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will \nbe worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the \nconcerned cluster. \n31.2.4 \n Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years as mentioned above Such long \nterm continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers \nthrough investment out of the premium savings in various welfare activities for socio-economic \ndevelopment of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthcare/education, \nfarm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an \nopportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative \ninteraction and business relationship and service effectiveness.  \n31.2.5 \n The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of \ncorresponding previous season.  In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and \nnecessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if \nfound at fault may be taken by GOI.   \n31.2.6 \n State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more, \nthreshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units, \ncalamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself \nbefore floating the formal tender notice. \n32. \n Clustering /clubbing of districts for bidding by the State \n \nIn order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State \nGovernment are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of \ndistricts/ area with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large \nState have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon  volume of risk \nassociated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purpose of \nclustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI) \nbecomes low and risk is shared and diversified. States may form the clusters of districts based on \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n63 \nmixed agro-climatic zones. i) Districts of high risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro-\nclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.  \n \nPrior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the \nInsurance Companies. \n \nThe object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives: \n• \nCluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.  \n• \nDifferent Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the \ndiversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer. \n• \nCluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of \nrisk within a cluster. \n• \nCrop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored in \ncluster formation. \n1. \nHence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts.  As per 2016 \nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 \nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost \n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability \nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower \nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment. \n2. \n Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for \nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop \nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby \nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived \nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to \ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level \nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned \ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in \nclustering. \n3. \n These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method \ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW. \n4. \n The detail illustration for classification of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and \ndetermination of L1 bidder are at Annexure 1. \n \n \n \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n64 \n33. \n Assessment of Performance and De-empanelment of Insurance \nCompanies  \n33.1 \n The performance of the empanelled Insurance Companies shall be closely monitored by DAC & FW on \n2 years interval through ascertaining the company’s skills and efficiencies for providing cost effective \nbetter insurance services to farmers. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix \ncontaining key performance indicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at \nAnnexure 2. \n \n34. \n Evaluation of Efficiency of Nodal Department of the State \n34.1 \n The efficiency evaluation of the State Nodal Department shall also be closely monitored by DAC & FW \non every 1 year interval through ascertaining the State’s efficiency and execution / implementation of \nthe Scheme. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix containing key performance \nindicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at Annexure 3. \n \n35. \n Role and Responsibilities of Various Agencies \n \nFor \nsuccessful \nimplementation \nand \nadministration \nof \nScheme, \nroles \nof \nvarious \nAgencies/Institutions/Govt.

DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance \n(www.pmfby.gov.in) and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for \ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of \nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is \nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby \nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information \naccess, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective \ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and \nyield/weather data providers with National Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching \nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst \nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the \nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it \nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is \navailable in two languages – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages. \n36.3 \n The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate \nadministrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a \nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance \nservices. \n36.4 \n The conceptualisation and development of web-portal has already been completed and launched \nhowever development and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below \nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.  \n36.4.1 \n Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance \nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed \nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay-Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation \nof funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement. \n36.4.2 \n Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company: For \nseamless and real-time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of \nNational Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance Companies will be \nestablished. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange \nplatform. \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n76 \n• \nFarmer’s enrolment and premium remittance,  \n• \nInformation and reports regarding mid-term/preventive sowing/individual/localized claims and  \n• \nAY/TY data for final claim calculation and remittance of claims into farmer’s bank account. \n \n36.4.3 \n Integration of Digital Land Records: Various State Govts. are working on digitization of land records \nand providing facility to land owners to identify and take records of land parcels owned by them. The \nsame digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal \nfollowed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This \nfacility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is \nprevalent currently. \n36.4.4 \n Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic \nWeather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges across the country will be procured from IMD and \nintegrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real-time monitoring of weather \nparameters, agro-climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid-term \nadversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather \ndata to concerned Insurance Companies and automated claim  calculation and remittance to \nbeneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real-time information about crop loss and payable \nclaims vis-a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy \ndecisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken. \n36.4.5 \n Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For bringing efficiency in addressing the grievances \nof farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations \nand resolution will be integrated with the Portal.   \n36.4.6 \n Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web-Portal: A quick response system is very \ncrucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders. \nKeeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all \nthe stakeholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination. \n36.4.7 \n Development of Mobile-App for Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Loss Assessment and \nreporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information sharing and reporting of \nLocalized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss \nassessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop \nInsurance Portal which will be accessed by all the stakeholders. This will help in monitoring and faster \nanalysis and claim settlement. \n36.4.8 \n Integration of Interest Subvention Scheme with Crop Insurance: A web-portal for Interest Subvention \nScheme is also being developed for monitoring and implementation of ISS. This Portal will be inter-\nlinked with the National Crop Insurance Portal for automatic enrolment of eligible farmers and \ndeduction of applicable premium. This will also enable de-duplication of KCC/seasonal Crop Loans and \nprovisioning of services \n36.4.9 \n Integration of RST/Satellite Data for handling Data Discrepancy/dispute resolution: New Age \nTechnologies like Remote Sensing Technology is a promising step in bringing in procedures and \n \nwww.pmfby.gov.in \nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY \n77 \nsystems of approach which is more reliable, accurate and fast in resolving errors/concerns of \nstakeholders and provide a progressive and scientific solution which the traditional/existing \nprocedures and practices are unable to provide.

There is a growing \nawareness world over on the need for promoting environmentally sustainable ag­\nriculture practices.\nIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) is a globally accepted strategy for promoting \nsustainable agriculture.  During last century, IPM relied substantially on economic \nthreshold level and chemical pesticides driven approaches. However, since the late \n1990s there  is conscious shift to more ecologically sustainable Agro-Eco System \nAnalysis (AESA) based IPM strategies. The AESA based IPM focuses on the rela­\ntionship among various components of an agro-ecosystem wtih special focus on \npest-defender dynamics, innate abilities of plant to compensate for the damages \ncaused by the pests and the influence of abiotic factors on pest buildup. In addi­\ntion, Ecological Engineering for pest management - a new paradigm to enhance \nthe natural enemies of pests in an agro-ecosystem is being considered as an im­\nportant strategy.  The ecological approach stresses the need for relying on bio in­\ntensive strategies prior to use of chemical pesticides.\nSincere efforts have been made by resource personnel to incorporate ecological­\nly based principles and field proven technologies for guidance of the extension \nofficers to educate, motivate and guide the farmers to adopt AESA based IPM \nstrategies, which are environmentally sustainable. I hope that the AESA based IPM \npackages will be relied upon by various stakeholders relating to Central and State \ngovernment functionaries involved in extension and Scientists of SAUs and ICAR \ninstitutions in their endeavour to promote environmentally sustainable agricul­\nture practices.\nDate : 6.3.2014                                                                                       (Avinash K. Srivastava)\nJoint Secretary\nGovernment of India\nMinistry of Agriculture\n(Department of Agriculture & Cooperation)\nKrishi Bhawan, New Delhi - 110001\nFOREWORD\nIPM as a holistic approach of crop protection based on the integration of multiple \nstrategies viz., cultural, physical, mechanical, biological, botanical and chemical. \nOver the years IPM underwent several changes, shifting its focus from damage \nboundary, economic injury to economic threshold. Currently most stake holders \nrely upon economic threshold levels (ETL) and tend to  apply chemical pesticides \nat the first instance in the event of a pest attack, through Government of India \nhas advocated need based and judicious application of chemicals. This approach \nis likely to cause adverse effects on agro-ecosystems and increase the cost of agri­\ncultural production due to problems of pest resurgence, insecticide resistance and \nsustainability. \n\t\nDuring the late 90s FAO started advocating Agro-Ecosystem Analysis \n(AESA) based IPM. Experience in different countries have sine show that AESA, \nwhich takes into account ecological principles and relies on the balance that is \nmaintained by biotic factors in an ecosystem has also resulted in reduction in cost \nof production and increase in yields. AESA based IPM also takes into account the \nneed for active participation of farmers and promotes experiential learning and \ndiscovery based decision making by farmers. AESA based IPM in conjunction with \necological engineering for pest management promotes bio-intensive strategies as \nagainst current chemical intensive approaches, while retaining the option to apply \nchemical pesticides judiciously as a measure of last resort.\n\t\nThe resource persons of NIPHM and DPPQ&S have made sincere efforts \nin revising IPM packages for different crops by incorporating agro-ecosystem anal­\nysis, ecological engineering, pesticide application techniques and other IPM op­\ntions with the active cooperation of crop based plant protection scientists working \nin state Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutions. I hope this IPM package will \nserve as a ready reference for extension functionaries of Central / State Govern­\nments, NGOs and progressive farmers in adopting sustainable plant protection \nstrategies by minimizing the dependence on chemical pesticides. \n                                                                                                                        (Utpal Kumar Singh)\nDr. K.

In order to address the adverse impacts of chemical pesticides on \nagro-ecosystems, Integrated Pest Management has evolved further from ETL based \napproach to Agro-ecosystem Analysis based Integrated Pest Management (IPM).\n\t\nIn AESA based IPM the whole agro-ecosystem, plant health at different \nstages, built-in-compensation abilities of the plant, pest and defender population \ndynamics, soil  conditions, climatic factors and farmers’ past experience are consid­\nered. In AESA, informed decisions are taken by farmers after field observation , AESA \nchart preparation followed by group discussion and decision making. Insect zoo is \ncreated to enable the farmer understand predation of pests by Natural Enemies. AESA \nbased PHM also results in reduction of chemical pesticide usage and conserves the \nagro-ecosystems.\n\t\nEcological Engineering for Pest Management, a new paradigm, is gaining \nacceptance as a strategy for promoting Biointensive Integrated Pest Management. \nEcological Engineering for Pest Management relies on cultural practices to effect hab­\nitat manipulation and enhance biological control. The strategies focus on pest man­\nagement both below ground and above ground. There is growing need to integrate \nAESA based IPM and principles of ecological engineering for pest management.\n\t\nThere is a rising public concern about the potential adverse effects of \nchemical pesticides on the human health, environment and biodiversity. The inten­\nsity of these negative externalities, through cannot be eliminated altogether, can be \nminimized through development, dissemination and promotion of sustainable bio­\nintensive approaches.\n\t\nDirectorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage (DPPQS), has de­\nveloped IPM package of practices during 2001 and 2002. These packages are current­\nly providing guidance to the Extension Officers in transferring IPM strategies to farm­\ners. These IPM package of practices, have been revised incorporating the principles \nof AESA based IPM in detail and  also the concept of Ecological Engineering for Pest \nManagement. It is hoped that the suggested practices, which aim at enhancing biodi­\nversity, biointensive strategies for pest management and promotion of plant health, \nwill enable the farmers to take informed decisions based on experiential learning and \nit will also result in use of chemical pesticides only as a last resort & in a safe and judi­\ncious manner.\n                                                                                                                                    (K.

Agro-ecosystem analysis\n\t\nThe integrated pest management (IPM) has been evolving over the decades \nto address the deleterious impacts of synthetic chemical pesticides on environment \nultimately affecting the interests of the farmers. The economic threshold level (ETL) \nwas the basis for several decades but in modern IPM (FAO 2002) emphasis is given \nto AESA where farmers take decisions based on larger range of field observations. \nThe health of a plant is determined by its environment which includes physical \nfactors (i.e. soil, wind, rain sunshine hours etc.) and biological factors (i.e. pests, \ndiseases and weeds). All these factors can play a role in the balance which exists \nbetween herbivore insects and their natural enemies. Understanding the intricate \ninteractions in an ecosystem can play a critical role in pest management.\n\t\nDecision making in pest management requires a thorough analysis of the \nagro-ecosystem. Farmer has to learn how to observe the crop, how to analyze the \nfield situation and how to make proper decisions for their crop management. This \nprocess is called the AESA. Participants of AESA will have to make a drawing on a \nlarge piece of paper (60 x 80 cm), to include all their observations. The advantage of \nusing a drawing is that it requires the participants/farmers to observe closely and \nintensively. It is a focal point for the analysis and for the discussions that follow, and \nthe drawing can be kept as a record.\n\t\nAESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension \nfunctionaries and farmers to analyze the field situations with regards to pests, \ndefenders, soil conditions, plant health and the influence of climatic factors and \ntheir relationship for growing a healthy crop. The basic components of AESA are:\n· \nPlant health at different stages\n· \nBuilt-in compensation abilities of plants\n· \nPest and defender population dynamics\n· \nSoil conditions\n· \nClimatic factors\n· \nFarmers past experience\nPrinciples of AESA based Integrated Pest Management (IPM):\nGrow a healthy crop\n· \nSelect a variety resistant/tolerant to major pests\n· \nTreat the seed with recommended pesticides especially biopesticides\n· \nSelect healthy seeds and seedlings\n4\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\n· \nFollow proper spacing\n· \nSoil health improvement (mulching and green manuring)\n· \nNutrient management especially organic manures and biofertilizers \nbased on the soil test results. If the dosage of nitrogenous fertilizers is \ntoo high the crop becomes too succulent and therefore susceptible to \ninsects and diseases. If the dosage is too low, the crop growth is retarded. \nSo, the farmers should apply an adequate for best results. The phosphatic \nfertilizers should not be applied each and every season as the residual \nphosphate of the previous season will be available for the current season \nalso. \n· \nProper irrigation\n· \nCrop rotation\nObserve the field regularly (climatic factors, soil and biotic factors)\nFarmers should \n· \nMonitor the field situations at least once a week (soil, water, plants, pests, \nnatural enemies, weather factors etc.)\n· \nMake decisions based on the field situation and P: D ratio\n· \nTake direct action when needed (e.g. collect egg masses, remove infested \nplants etc.)\n5\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nPlant compensation ability\n\t\nCompensation is deﬁned as the replacement of plant biomass lost to \nherbivores and has been associated with increased photosynthetic rates and \nmobilization of stored resources from source organs to sinks (e.g., from roots \nand remaining leaves to new leaves) during active vegetative growth period. \nPlant tolerance to herbivory can arise from the interaction of a variety of plant \ntraits and external environmental factors. Several studies have documented such \ncompensation through increased growth and photosynthetic rate.\nUnderstand and conserve defenders\n· \nKnow defenders/natural enemies to understand their role through \nregular observations of the agro-ecosystem\n· \nAvoid the use of chemical pesticides especially with broad-spectrum \nactivity\nInsect zoo\n\t\nIn field various types of insects are present. Some are beneficial and some \nmay be harmful. Generally farmers are not aware about it. Predators (friends of the \nfarmers) which feed on pests are not easy to observe in crop field. Insect zoo concept \ncan be helpful to enhance farmers’ skill to identify beneficial and harmful insects. \nIn this method, unfamiliar/unknown predators are collected in plastic containers \nwith brush from the field and brought to a place for study. Each predator is placed \ninside a plastic bottle together with parts of the plant and some known insect \npests. Insects in the bottle are observed for certain time and determined whether \nthe test insect is a pest (feeds on plant) or a predator (feeds on other insects).  \nPest: Defender ratio (P: D ratio):\n\t\nIdentifying the number of pests and beneficial insects helps the farmers to \nmake appropriate pest management decisions. Sweep net, visual counts etc. can \nbe adopted to arrive at the numbers of pests and defenders. The P: D ratio can \nvary depending on the feeding potential of natural enemy as well as the type of \npest. The natural enemies of cucurbit crops pests can be divided into 3 categories \n1. parasitoids; 2. predators; and 3. pathogens. The important natural enemies in \ncucurbit crops are given in ecological engineering on page 17.\n6\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nModel agro-ecosystem analysis chart\nDate:\nVillage:\nFarmer:\nDecision taken based on the analysis of field situation\nSoil conditions\t\n\t\n:\nWeather conditions\t\n:\nDiseases types and severity\t :\nWeeds types and intensity\t\n:\nRodent damage (if any)\t\n:\nNo. of insect pests\t \t\n:\nNo. of natural enemies\t\n:\nP: D ratio\t\t\n\t\n:\n7\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\n\t\nThe general rule to be adopted for management decisions relying on the P:D \nratio is 2: 1. However, some of the parasitoids and predators will be able to control \nmore than 2 pests. Wherever specific P:D ratios are not found, it is safer to adopt the \n2: 1, as P:D ratio. Whenever the P:D ratio is found to be favourable, there is no need \nfor adoption of other management strategies. In cases where the P:D ratio is found \nto be unfavourable, the farmers can be advised to resort to inundative release of \nparasitoids/predators depending upon the type of pest. In addition to inundative \nrelease of parasitoids and predators, the usage of microbial biopesticides and \nbiochemical biopesticides such as insect growth regulators, botanicals etc. can be \nrelied upon before resorting to synthetic chemical pesticides.\nFeeding/egg laying potential of different parasitoids/predators\nPredators/ Parasitoids\nFeeding potential/ Egg laying capacity\nLadybird beetle\nPredatory rate of adult coccinellid on aphids is 50 \naphids per day.\nHover fly\n1st instar larva can consume 15-19 aphids/day\n2nd instar larva can consume 45-52 aphids/day\n3rd instar larva can consume 80-90 aphids/day\nIn total life cycle they can consume approx. 400 aphids.\nGreen lacewing\nEach larva can consume 100 aphids, 329 pupa of \nwhitefly and 288 nymphs of jassids during  entire larval \nperiod.\nReduviid bug\n1st & 2nd nymphal instars can consume 1 small larva/day.\n3rd & 4th nymphal instars can consume 2 to 3 medium \nlarvae/day.\n5th nymphal instar & adult can consume 3 to 4 big \nlarvae/day.\nIn total life cycle they can consume approx. 250 to 300 \nlarvae.\n8\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nSpider\n5 big larvae/day.\nPredatory mite\nPredatory rate of adult is 20-35 phytophagous mites/\nfemale/day.\nBracon hebetor  \nEgg laying capacity is 100-200 eggs/female. 1-8 eggs/\nlarva.\nTrichogramma sp\nEgg laying capacity is 20-200 eggs/female.\n9\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nDecision making\nFarmers become experts in crop management\n\t\nFarmers have to make timely decisions about the management of their \ncrops.

The damage or losses \ncaused by a certain density of insects cannot be predicted at all. In ETL the due \nrecognition of the role of natural enemies in decreasing pest population is ignored. \nFarmers cannot base their decisions on just a simple count of pests. They will have \nto consider many other aspects of the crop (crop ecology, growth stage, natural \nenemies, weather condition, etc.) and their own economic and social situation \nbefore they can make the right crop management decisions. In ETL based IPM, \nnatural enemies, plant compensation ability and abiotic factors are not considered. \nIn AESA based IPM emphasis is given to natural enemies, plant compensation \nability, abiotic factors and P: D ratio.\nAESA and farmer field school (FFS)\nAESA is a season-long training activity that takes place in the farmer field. \nIt is season-long so that it covers all the different developmental stages of the crop \nand their related management practices.

Field Scouting \n\t\nAESA requires skill. So only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. \nHowever, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular \nintervals to monitor the major pest situation.\n\t\nSurveillance on pest occurrence at the main field should commence soon \nafter crop establishment after transplanting and at weekly intervals thereafter. In \neach of the fields, select five spots randomly. Select five random plants at each spot \nfor recording counts of insects as per procedure finalized for individual insects.\nFor sucking pests :\nFor aphids: Count and record the number of both nymphs and adults on five \nrandomly selected leaves per plant. \nFor leaf miner: Only the number of live mines on five randomly selected leaves per \nplant should be counted and recorded.\nFor Bactrocera, Raphidopalpa: Total number of fruits, damaged fruits due to \nBactrocera, Raphidopalpa and number of larvae on individual plants should be \ncounted and recorded.\nC. Yellow pan water trap/sticky traps\n\t\nSet up yellow pan water trap/sticky traps 15 cm above the canopy for \nmonitoring aphids @ 4-5 traps/acre. Locally available empty tins can be painted \nyellow/ coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used.\nD.  Light traps\n\t\nSet up light traps @ 1 trap/acre 15 cm above the crop canopy for \nmonitoring and mass trapping insects. Light traps with exit option for natural \nenemies of smaller size should be installed and operate around the dusk time \n(6 pm to 10 pm).\n14\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nIII. Ecological engineering for pest management\n\t\nEcological engineering for pest management has recently emerged as \na paradigm for considering pest management approaches that rely on the use \nof cultural techniques to effect habitat manipulation and to enhance biological \ncontrol. The cultural practices are informed by ecological knowledge rather than \non high technology approaches such as synthetic pesticides and genetically \nengineered crops. \nNatural enemies may require\n1.\t\nFood in the form of pollen and nectar for adult natural enemies.\n2.\t\nShelters such as overwintering sites, moderate microclimate, etc are needed. \n3.\t\nNatural enemies may also require alternate host when primary host are not \npresent.\nEcological Engineering for Pest Management – Above Ground :\n· \nRaising the flowering plants / compatible cash crops along  the field border \nby arranging shorter plants towards main crop and taller plants towards \nthe border to attract natural enemies as well as to avoid immigrating pest \npopulation.\n· \nGrowing flowering plants on the internal bunds inside the field.\n· \nNot to uproot weed plants those are growing naturally like Tidax procumbens, \nAgeratum sp. Alternanthera sp., which act as nectar source for natural enemies. \n· \nNot to apply broad spectrum chemical pesticides, when the P: D is favourable. \nThe plant compensation ability should also be considered before applying \nchemical pesticides.\nEcological Engineering for Pest Management – Below Ground :\n· \nCrop rotations with leguminous plants which enhance nitrogen content.\n· \nKeeping soils covered year-round with living vegetation and/or crop residue.\n· \nAdding organic matter in the form of farm yard manure (FYM), Vermicompost, \ncrop residue which enhance below ground biodiversity.\n· \nReducing tillage intensity so that hibernating natural enemies can be saved.\n· \nApplying balanced dose of nutrients using biofertilizers.\n· \nApplying Trichoderma and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed, nursery \ntreatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check \nfor label claim.

Insecticide resistance and its management\nInsecticide resistance: Resistance to insecticides may be defined as ‘a heritable \nchange in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated \nfailure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according \nto the label recommendation for that pest species’ (IRAC).  Cross-resistance occurs \nwhen resistance to one insecticide confers resistance to another insecticide, even \nwhere the insect has not been exposed to the latter product. \nCauses of resistance development: The causes and rate at which insecticide \nresistance develops depend on several factors, including how rapidly the insects \nreproduce, the insects’ level of resistance, the migration and host range of the \ninsects, the insecticide’s persistence and specificity, and the rate, timing and \nnumber of applications of insecticide made. For instance, insect pests that survive \nin large populations and breed quickly are at greater advantage of evolving \ninsecticide, especially when insecticides are misused or over-used.\nGeneral strategy for insecticide resistance management: The best strategy \nto avoid insecticide resistance is prevention and including insecticide resistance \nmanagement tactics as part of a larger integrated pest management (IPM) \napproach.\n1) Monitor pests: Monitor insect population development in fields to determine if \nand when control measures are warranted. Monitor and consider natural enemies \nwhen making control decisions. After treatment, continue monitoring to assess \npest populations and their control.\n2) Focus on AESA: Insecticides should be used only as a last resort when all other \nnon-chemical management options are exhausted and P:D ratio is above 2: 1.\n3) Take an integrated approach to managing pests: Use as many different control \nmeasures as possible. Select insecticides with care and consider the impact on \nfuture pest populations and the environment. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides \nwhen a narrow-spectrum or more specific insecticide will work.\n4) Time applications correctly: Apply insecticides when the pests are most \nvulnerable. Use application rates and intervals recommended by the manufacturer, \nuniversity insect management specialist, county Extension agent, or crop \nconsultant.\n5) Mix and apply carefully: While applying insecticides care should be taken for \nproper application of insecticides in terms of dose, volume, timing, coverage, using \ntechniques recommended by the manufacturer etc.\n6) Alternate different insecticide classes: Avoid the repeated use of the same \ninsecticide, insecticides in the same chemical class, or insecticides in different \nclasses with same mode of action and rotate/alternate insecticide classes and \nmodes of action.\n24\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\n7) Preserve susceptible genes: Preserve susceptible individuals within the target \npopulation by providing unsprayed areas within treated fields, adjacent “refuge” \nfields, or habitat attractions within a treated field that facilitate immigration. These \nsusceptible individuals may outcompete and interbreed with resistant individuals, \ndiluting the resistant genes and therefore the impact of resistance. \nVI. Nutritional deficiencies / disorders:\nNutrients and their deficiency symptoms\n1. Nitrogen\nDeficiency symptoms: Both vegetative growth \nand fruit production are severely restricted plants \nappear pale and spindly.  New leaves are small but \nremain green, whereas the oldest leaves turn yellow \nand die. The yellowing spreads up the shoot to \nyounger leaves.  Yield is reduced and fruit are pale, \nshort and thick.\nCorrection measure: Side-dress deficient in-ground crops with 20-50 kg N/acre, \nor apply fortnightly foliar sprays of 2% urea at high volume.\n2. Potassium\nDeficiency \nsymptoms: \nPotassium \ndeficiency \ncauses yellowing and scorching or older leaves. \nThese symptoms begin at the margins of the leaf \nand spread between the veins towards its centre.   \nLarge areas of tissue around the major veins remain \ngreen until the disorder is well advanced. A brown \nscorch develops in the yellow areas and spreads \nuntil the leaf is dry and papery.  Potassium from a fertilizer side-dressing will move \nfrom the soil surface to the roots only if the soil is very sandy.  Potassium fertilizers \nare therefore best incorporated in the soil before planting.   Fertigation or drip \nfeeding can also be used to treat a deficient crop.\nCorrection measure: Foliar spray of KCl 1% at weekly interval.\n3. Calcium\nDeficiency symptoms: Emerging leaves appear \nscorched and distorted and may cup downwards \nbecause the leaf margins have failed to expand fully.  \nMature and older leaves are generally unaffected.   \nWith a severe deficiency, flowers can abort, and the \ngrowing point may die.   Fruits from calcium-defi­\ncient plants are smaller and tasteless, and may fail to \ndevelop normally at the blossom end.\nCorrection measure: Soil application of gypsum as per gypsum requirement \nbased on soil test report or by foliar spray of CaSO4 @  2% solution in water.\n25\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\n4. Magnesium\nDeficiency symptoms: Magnesium deficiency \ncauses yellowing of older leaves. The symptom \nbegins between the major veins, which retain a \nnarrow green border.  A light tan burn will develop \nin the yellow regions if the deficiency is severe.  Fruit \nyields are reduced. \nCorrection measure: Incorporate magnetite (300 kg/ac) or dolomite (800 kg/ac) \ninto deficient soils before planting.  Fortnightly foliar sprays of MgSO4 (2 kg/100 L) \nat high volume (500-1000 L/ac).\n5. Boron\nDeficiency symptoms: Distortion of newer leaves \n(in severe cases the growing point dies) and the ap­\npearance of a broad yellow border at the margins \nof the oldest leaves. Young fruit can die or abort; \nabortion rates are high. Stunted development and \nmottled yellow longitudinal streaks, which develop \ninto corky marking (scurfing) along the skin.\nCorrection measure: Foliar spray of 0.2% Borax at forthrightly interval. Application \nof 10 kg borax per hectare to deficient soil before will prevent boron deficiency. \n6. Iron\nDeficiency symptoms: Iron deficiency causes a uni­\nform pale green chlorosis of the newest leaves; all \nother leaves remain dark green.  Initially, the veins \nremain green, which gives a net-like pattern.  If the \ndeficiency is severe, the minor veins also fade, and \nthe leaves may eventually burn, especially if ex­\nposed to strong sunlight. Good drainage and soil \naeration favour iron availability. Foliar sprays of iron sulphate (150 g/100 L) can be \nused to treat symptoms\nCorrection measure: Foliar spray of 0.5% FeSO4.\n7. Manganese\nDeficiency symptoms: The veins of middle to up­\nper leaves of manganese-deficient plants appear \ngreen against the mottled pale green to yellow of \nthe blade.\nCorrection measure: Spray the foliage with MnSO4 \n@ 0.1% (100 g/100 L water).\nhttp://www.haifa-group.com/knowledge_center/deficiencies/crops/vegetables/cucumber/\n26\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nPhysiological and nutritional disorders:\n1.\t\nBlossom end rot: It is a physiological disorder observed in many cucurbits \nas well other crops. It typically appears as a general rot at the blossom end \nof developing fruit. Blossom end rot is usually the result of inadequate or \nuneven irrigation high humidity, or their factor that slow the movement of \nwater movement can often lead to temporary calcium deficiencies, resulting \nin blossom end rot.\n\t\nManagement: provide adequate calcicum fertility and proper irrigation. Do \nnot use high levels of ammonia fertilizer, which can aggravate this problem. \nAvoid toot injury \n2.\t\nDrought stress: cucurbits are particularly sensitive to drought. Fruit \nare typically 85% to 90% water and can suffer under drought condition. \nPumpkins often produce long vines with many leaves and can transpire large",

Cucurbit fruit fly:\nIt is one of the important pests on gourds like bittergourd, snakegourd, \nmelons, coccinia etc., throughout the country\nBiology:\nEgg: The female fly oviposits on soft fruits. Cavity is made by sharp ovipositor \nand 12 cylindrical eggs are laid in the evening time and exuding gummy \nsubstance covers, cements and makes it water proof. Female lays 58-95 eggs \nin 14-54 days. Egg period is 1-3 days.\nMaggot: The maggots are apodus, acephalous, dirty white, wriggling \ncreatures, thicker at posterior end and tapering at the other to a point. \nLarval period is 5-7 days in summer and about three weeks in winter.  Mature \nmaggots come out and jump to ground and select suitable place, enter soil \nand pupate.\nPupa: Pupa is barrel shaped. \nAdult: Adult flies emerge from pupa during morning hours and mate at dusk. \nAdults are reddish brown with lemon yellow markings on thorax with spotted \nwings. It is active throughout the year.

They are polyphagous and feed predominantly on cucurbits, \ncucurbits, potato, and kidney beans as well as eggplant. These beetles are \nconsidered to be one of the most serious groups of pests damaging eggplant. \nIn addition, they also feed on other Solanaceous plants such as S. nigrum, \nS. xanthocarpum, S. torvum, Datura sp, Physalis sp and Withania somnifera.\nBiology:\nEgg: The females lay eggs mostly on the lower leaf surfaces. Each female lays \nabout 100-400 eggs. The egg is spindle-shaped and yellowish in color. Eggs \nare laid in clusters of 10-40. The egg period varies from two to five days.\nGrub: The grub is creamy white or yellowish in color with black spiny hairs on \nthe body. The grub period is two to five weeks depending on the temperature. \nGrubs pupate on the leaves and stem.\nPupa: The pupa resembles the grub but is mostly darker in color, although it \nsometimes is yellowish in color. The pupa bears spiny hairs on the posterior, \nbut not the anterior, part of the body. The pupal period is one to two weeks.\nAdult: The subfamily Epilachninae contains plant-feeding ladybird beetles \nbecause most other ladybird beetles are predators, not plant pests. These \nbrownish or orange- colored, hemispherical beetles are larger than other \nladybird species. E. vigintioctopunctata (in Latin, viginti means 20 and \nocto means 8) has 28 black spots on the forewing (elytra). E. dodecastigma \n(dodecam means 12 in Greek) has 12 black spots on the elytra. However, \nbeetles with 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 or 26 spots have been observed under field \nconditions, due to mating between females of E. dodecastigma and males of \nE. vigintioctopunctata.\n38\nAESA based IPM – Cucurbitaceous\nLife cycle:\nDamage symptoms:\n\t\nThe grub and adult have chewing mouthparts. Hence, they scrape the \nchlorophyll from the epidermal layers of the leaves. The feeding results in a \ntypical ladder-like window. The windows will dry and drop off, leaving holes in \nthe leaves. In severe infestations, several windows coalesce together and lead \nto skeletonization i.e. the formation of a papery structure on the leaf.\nParasitoids: \n1 Braconid wasp, 2.

At the time of the harvest\n\t\nThe cucumber crop is ready for harvest about 45-60 days after sowing, \ndepending on cultivars and growing conditions. The fruits take about 7–10 days \nfrom setting to reach marketable stage. Fruit size during harvesting depends on \nthe purpose of use or market requirement. Fruits for salad or slicing are picked \nwhen they are 15-25 cm long; for pickles they are harvested when they are 5-15 cm \nlong. The fruits should be picked at 2-day intervals\nB. Safety measures for post-harvest storage\n\t\nCucumbers are harvested at a range of developmental stages. Depending on \ncultivar and temperature, the time from flowering to harvest may be 55 to 60 days. \nGenerally fruit are harvested at a slightly immature stage, near full size but before \nseeds fully enlarge and harden. Firmness and external glossiness are also indicators \nof a pre-maturity condition. At proper harvest maturity, a jellylike material has \nbegun to form in the seed cavity.\n\t\nStorage of cucumber is generally less than 14 days as visual and sensory",

    "question": "uality deteriorate rapidly. Shriveling, yellowing, and decay are likely to increase \nfollowing storage beyond two weeks, especially after removal to typical retail \nconditions. Short term storage or transit temperatures below this range (such as \n7.2°C (45°F)) are commonly used but will result in chilling injury after 2-3 days.\n \t\nCucumbers are chilling sensitive at temperatures below 10°C (50°F) if held for \nmore than a day to 3 days depending on temperature and cultivar. Consequences \nof chilling injury are water-soaked areas, pitting and accelerated decay. Chilling \ninjury is cumulative and may be initiated in the field prior to harvest.

    "question": "ue approach that aims to demonstrate & popularize \nthe improved technologies at the farmers’ fields for efficient and profitable management of \nresources and to provide a direct interface between subject matter specialists (including \nresearchers) and farmers. On the principle of ‘Seeing is Believing’, demonstrations not only act",
    "answer": "s a wheel to transfer the latest technology to the farmers but also simultaneously motivate \nfarmers for its quick acceptability and adoptability besides getting direct feedback from the \nfarmer’s field about the technology demonstrated so as to improvise and fine tuned the \ntechnology.  \n \nThe subject matter specialists (including researchers) provide technological inputs to \nthe extension personnel and consenting farmers to organize the demonstrations as per \ntechnology developed. To make the technologies farmer’s friendly, subject matter specialists \n(including researchers) and extension personnel need to understand and analyse the farmer’s \nwisdom, his/her resources and requirement in depth, so as to raise the farmers acceptability \nand adoptability about the technologies. These demonstrations are conducted on consenting \nfarmer’s fields on participatory approach with a view to demonstrate the potentiality of the \ntechnologies to (a) participating farmers (b) neighboring farmers & other agencies (c) analyze \nthe performance of the technologies for scientific feedback and its improvisation and above all \n(d) build confidence amongst the farmers about  the technology developed. \n \nDuring the current financial year (2019-20), Model Villages Programme on pilot \nbasis has been taken up under Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme. It includes adoption of one \nvillage per block for land holding based Soil Sampling, Testing & Distribution of Soil Health \nCards and subsequent SHC based demonstrations in each Model village besides organizing \none Fair/Mela per village for scaling up awareness creation amongst the farmers across India.  \nConducting demonstrations at farmers fields and organizing farmer’s Fair/Mela is of \nutmost importance to raise awareness and to disseminate SHC based recommendations \n(hereinafter SHC Technology) amongst the farmers across India besides optimizing fertilizer \nuse.  \n \n1. Selection of Villages and Beneficiaries for Demonstrating SHC Technology   \na) \nParticipatory approach may be followed in conducting demonstrations associating (i) \nsubject matter specialists (ii) extension personnel and (iii) demonstrating farmers \nincluding neighboring one’s, so as to have an effective implementation leading to \nbetter adoption and diffusion of technology amongst the farmers. \nb) \nTo create better and visible impact of SHC technology, the demonstrations may as \nfar as possible be conducted in cluster approach, depending upon the number of \ndemonstrations earmarked for each model village. The size of the one \ndemonstration at individual farmer’s fields should not be more than one hectare.  \nc) \nOther equal size plots of the demonstrating farmers or the equal size plot of the \nneighboring farmers on the similar soil-site Soilscape under the same crop (variety) \nmay be considered as check or control plot (i.e. without SHC technology) for \nobjective comparison of the results. \nd) \nSpecial attention towards soil problems like soil acidity, salinity/sodicity, soil borne \npests and diseases should be tackled before taking up the demonstrations.  \ne) \nSelection and Identification of consenting and demonstrating farmers/beneficiaries \nshall be carried out by the state/uts implementing department as per the \nrequirement/aptitude of the farmers.  \nf) \nThe Socio-economically backward/Small/Marginal/ST/SC/OBC/ women farmers be \ngiven due preference as beneficiaries while selecting and conducting the \ndemonstrations. \n \n2. Funding for Demonstrations \n  \nThe assistance to demonstrate SHC technology at farmers fields to the beneficiary-\nfarmer should not exceed Rs 2500/- per ha. The assistance under demonstrations is meant \nfor fertilizers and organic manures apart from soil ameliorants, bio-fertilizers and micro-\nnutrients. Ensure that the assistance in the form of inputs as recommended in the Soil \nHealth Cards are to be provided to the beneficiary farmers.  \nThe expenditure in excess of the approved norms per hectare if any, should be \nincurred by the beneficiary-farmer. \nFunds earmarked for demonstrations may be made available to the concerned in-\ncharge, organizing the demonstrations well before the start of the crop sowing for arranging \nthe inputs. \n \n3. Implementing Agency \n \nThe department of agriculture of all the States/UTs are the Nodal departments for \norganizing the demonstrations at the farmer’s fields in their respective States/UTs. \nStates/UTs may organize the demonstrations at farmer’s fields in the model villages \nthrough their respective district level functionaries. States/Uts may rope in Krishi Vigyan \nKendras (KVKs under ICAR system), State Agriculture Universities and reputed & \nregistered NGOs for professional know how and guidance. \n \nAll States/Uts are require to constitute a dedicated  district level teams with a \ncompetent team leader, designated as District Nodal Officer (D.N.O) for the proper \nimplementation and supervision of the demonstrations in the model villages. \nStates/Uts are also require to send the names, designation, contact details of the \nrespective distt. Nodal Officer to this division on the attached format. \n \n \n \n \n4. Planning for the Demonstration \n \nA base line survey of the each model village may be conducted to (a) ascertain the \nsocio-economic conditions of the farmers; (b) farming situations under which the crop is \ngrown (c) the existing level of fertiliser consumption, nutrient deficiencies in the soil, \nproductivity and the adoption of SHC technology. This will serve as a broad benchmark for \nfuture planning of demonstrations and evaluation.  \nA resource constraint analysis may be carried out of the beneficiaries and \nindividual demonstration plot to identify the critical factors for the adoption of SHC \ntechnologies by the farmers. \nAdvance planning may be done for the demonstrations so that all the critical inputs \nare arranged well in advance by the implementing deptt/agency. \nOrientation training may be organized by the States/Uts involving KVKs/SAU’s for \nall the participating farmers/persons in respect of SHC technology including aims and \nobjectives of the demonstrations to be conducted so as to maintain inter & intra States/Uts \nuniformity in conducting demonstrations in the model villages. \n \n5. Implementation \n \n1. \nBefore conducting the demonstration, States/Uts implementing departments must \narrange two khasra / patwari / cadastral maps for each model village from the \nappropriate authority, one for the preparation of location map of each model village by \nplotting all the Soil Samples Collected in the model village against khasra no. on the \ncadastral map and the other one for marking the demonstration (with nos) on the village \ncadastral map that also against the khasra nos. \n2. \nAll these demonstration be Geo-referenced & Geo-fenced.   \n3. \nIn order to generate Soil Fertility Maps of model villages, a Geo-referenced cadastral \nmap with field boundaries & khasra nos may also be arranged. States/Uts are require \nto send the Geo-referenced maps of each model village along with SHC data of all the \n12 parameters tested and location map as mentioned above (Sl. No. 1) for the pilot \nproject 2019-20 to SLUSI at ssohq-slusi@gov.in for the generation of Soil Fertility Maps \nof each model villages. \n4. \nImplementing department must display a board in front of the demonstration/control plot \nmentioning all details of beneficiary and SHC technology being demonstrated. \n5. \nAll participating persons including farmers may be informed well in advance about the \ndate and place of the demonstration to be conducted. On the occasion, the \nneighbouring farmers and the farmers of the adjoining villages may also be invited. \nThey should be educated about the details of the SHC technologies and objectives of \nthe demonstrations. Application of SHC based inputs & sowing of the crops need to be \ndone in the presence of participating farmers/persons. \n6. \nAll the farm operations are to be carried out by the demonstrating farmers under the \nclose supervision and guidance of the in-charge of demonstrations and extension \npersonnel. \n \n \n7. \nField days are to be organized during the different stages of the crop growth, where \nneighbouring farmers including farm women be invited so that they may see \nthemselves the difference between farmers practice (i.e. without SHC technology) & \nSHC technology.  \n8. \nThe information pertaining to SHC interventions adopted on demonstrations plot over \ncontrol must be recorded, interpreted, compiled & evaluated scientifically. \n9. \nThe concerned in-charge is to keep records of various expenses incurred on SHC \nbased inputs used for the demonstrations plot (s) and check/control plot (s) for deriving \ncost benefits and other interpretations. \n10. \nAfter the harvesting and threshing of the crop, the yield (grain & straw etc.) are to be \nrecorded for demonstration plot and check/control plot separately. \n11. \nIn order to monitor the programme, the information as mentioned in Annexure I to VI \nmay be collected & compiled village & district-wise by the concerned in-charge \norganizing the demonstrations. \n \n6. Monitoring \n \nState/Uts-wise Monitoring Teams meant for the model village programme has \nalready been constituted vide OM no. 16-5/2019-Fert.

    "question": "ue approach that aims to demonstrate & popularize \nthe improved technologies at the farmers’ fields for efficient and profitable management of \nresources and to provide a direct interface between subject matter specialists (including \nresearchers) and farmers. On the principle of ‘Seeing is Believing’, demonstrations not only act",
    "answer": "s a wheel to transfer the latest technology to the farmers but also simultaneously motivate \nfarmers for its quick acceptability and adoptability besides getting direct feedback from the \nfarmer’s field about the technology demonstrated so as to improvise and fine tuned the \ntechnology.  \n \nThe subject matter specialists (including researchers) provide technological inputs to \nthe extension personnel and consenting farmers to organize the demonstrations as per \ntechnology developed. To make the technologies farmer’s friendly, subject matter specialists \n(including researchers) and extension personnel need to understand and analyse the farmer’s \nwisdom, his/her resources and requirement in depth, so as to raise the farmers acceptability \nand adoptability about the technologies. These demonstrations are conducted on consenting \nfarmer’s fields on participatory approach with a view to demonstrate the potentiality of the \ntechnologies to (a) participating farmers (b) neighboring farmers & other agencies (c) analyze \nthe performance of the technologies for scientific feedback and its improvisation and above all \n(d) build confidence amongst the farmers about  the technology developed. \n \nDuring the current financial year (2019-20), Model Villages Programme on pilot \nbasis has been taken up under Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme. It includes adoption of one \nvillage per block for land holding based Soil Sampling, Testing & Distribution of Soil Health \nCards and subsequent SHC based demonstrations in each Model village besides organizing \none Fair/Mela per village for scaling up awareness creation amongst the farmers across India.  \nConducting demonstrations at farmers fields and organizing farmer’s Fair/Mela is of \nutmost importance to raise awareness and to disseminate SHC based recommendations \n(hereinafter SHC Technology) amongst the farmers across India besides optimizing fertilizer \nuse.  \n \n1. Selection of Villages and Beneficiaries for Demonstrating SHC Technology   \na) \nParticipatory approach may be followed in conducting demonstrations associating (i) \nsubject matter specialists (ii) extension personnel and (iii) demonstrating farmers \nincluding neighboring one’s, so as to have an effective implementation leading to \nbetter adoption and diffusion of technology amongst the farmers. \nb) \nTo create better and visible impact of SHC technology, the demonstrations may as \nfar as possible be conducted in cluster approach, depending upon the number of \ndemonstrations earmarked for each model village. The size of the one \ndemonstration at individual farmer’s fields should not be more than one hectare.  \nc) \nOther equal size plots of the demonstrating farmers or the equal size plot of the \nneighboring farmers on the similar soil-site Soilscape under the same crop (variety) \nmay be considered as check or control plot (i.e. without SHC technology) for \nobjective comparison of the results. \nd) \nSpecial attention towards soil problems like soil acidity, salinity/sodicity, soil borne \npests and diseases should be tackled before taking up the demonstrations.  \ne) \nSelection and Identification of consenting and demonstrating farmers/beneficiaries \nshall be carried out by the state/uts implementing department as per the \nrequirement/aptitude of the farmers.  \nf) \nThe Socio-economically backward/Small/Marginal/ST/SC/OBC/ women farmers be \ngiven due preference as beneficiaries while selecting and conducting the \ndemonstrations. \n \n2. Funding for Demonstrations \n  \nThe assistance to demonstrate SHC technology at farmers fields to the beneficiary-\nfarmer should not exceed Rs 2500/- per ha. The assistance under demonstrations is meant \nfor fertilizers and organic manures apart from soil ameliorants, bio-fertilizers and micro-\nnutrients. Ensure that the assistance in the form of inputs as recommended in the Soil \nHealth Cards are to be provided to the beneficiary farmers.  \nThe expenditure in excess of the approved norms per hectare if any, should be \nincurred by the beneficiary-farmer. \nFunds earmarked for demonstrations may be made available to the concerned in-\ncharge, organizing the demonstrations well before the start of the crop sowing for arranging \nthe inputs. \n \n3. Implementing Agency \n \nThe department of agriculture of all the States/UTs are the Nodal departments for \norganizing the demonstrations at the farmer’s fields in their respective States/UTs. \nStates/UTs may organize the demonstrations at farmer’s fields in the model villages \nthrough their respective district level functionaries. States/Uts may rope in Krishi Vigyan \nKendras (KVKs under ICAR system), State Agriculture Universities and reputed & \nregistered NGOs for professional know how and guidance. \n \nAll States/Uts are require to constitute a dedicated  district level teams with a \ncompetent team leader, designated as District Nodal Officer (D.N.O) for the proper \nimplementation and supervision of the demonstrations in the model villages. \nStates/Uts are also require to send the names, designation, contact details of the \nrespective distt. Nodal Officer to this division on the attached format. \n \n \n \n \n4. Planning for the Demonstration \n \nA base line survey of the each model village may be conducted to (a) ascertain the \nsocio-economic conditions of the farmers; (b) farming situations under which the crop is \ngrown (c) the existing level of fertiliser consumption, nutrient deficiencies in the soil, \nproductivity and the adoption of SHC technology. This will serve as a broad benchmark for \nfuture planning of demonstrations and evaluation.  \nA resource constraint analysis may be carried out of the beneficiaries and \nindividual demonstration plot to identify the critical factors for the adoption of SHC \ntechnologies by the farmers. \nAdvance planning may be done for the demonstrations so that all the critical inputs \nare arranged well in advance by the implementing deptt/agency. \nOrientation training may be organized by the States/Uts involving KVKs/SAU’s for \nall the participating farmers/persons in respect of SHC technology including aims and \nobjectives of the demonstrations to be conducted so as to maintain inter & intra States/Uts \nuniformity in conducting demonstrations in the model villages. \n \n5. Implementation \n \n1. \nBefore conducting the demonstration, States/Uts implementing departments must \narrange two khasra / patwari / cadastral maps for each model village from the \nappropriate authority, one for the preparation of location map of each model village by \nplotting all the Soil Samples Collected in the model village against khasra no. on the \ncadastral map and the other one for marking the demonstration (with nos) on the village \ncadastral map that also against the khasra nos. \n2. \nAll these demonstration be Geo-referenced & Geo-fenced.   \n3. \nIn order to generate Soil Fertility Maps of model villages, a Geo-referenced cadastral \nmap with field boundaries & khasra nos may also be arranged. States/Uts are require \nto send the Geo-referenced maps of each model village along with SHC data of all the \n12 parameters tested and location map as mentioned above (Sl. No. 1) for the pilot \nproject 2019-20 to SLUSI at ssohq-slusi@gov.in for the generation of Soil Fertility Maps \nof each model villages. \n4. \nImplementing department must display a board in front of the demonstration/control plot \nmentioning all details of beneficiary and SHC technology being demonstrated. \n5. \nAll participating persons including farmers may be informed well in advance about the \ndate and place of the demonstration to be conducted. On the occasion, the \nneighbouring farmers and the farmers of the adjoining villages may also be invited. \nThey should be educated about the details of the SHC technologies and objectives of \nthe demonstrations. Application of SHC based inputs & sowing of the crops need to be \ndone in the presence of participating farmers/persons. \n6. \nAll the farm operations are to be carried out by the demonstrating farmers under the \nclose supervision and guidance of the in-charge of demonstrations and extension \npersonnel. \n \n \n7. \nField days are to be organized during the different stages of the crop growth, where \nneighbouring farmers including farm women be invited so that they may see \nthemselves the difference between farmers practice (i.e. without SHC technology) & \nSHC technology.  \n8. \nThe information pertaining to SHC interventions adopted on demonstrations plot over \ncontrol must be recorded, interpreted, compiled & evaluated scientifically. \n9. \nThe concerned in-charge is to keep records of various expenses incurred on SHC \nbased inputs used for the demonstrations plot (s) and check/control plot (s) for deriving \ncost benefits and other interpretations. \n10. \nAfter the harvesting and threshing of the crop, the yield (grain & straw etc.) are to be \nrecorded for demonstration plot and check/control plot separately. \n11. \nIn order to monitor the programme, the information as mentioned in Annexure I to VI \nmay be collected & compiled village & district-wise by the concerned in-charge \norganizing the demonstrations. \n \n6. Monitoring \n \nState/Uts-wise Monitoring Teams meant for the model village programme has \nalready been constituted vide OM no. 16-5/2019-Fert. Use dated 29th August, 2019. \nTeams are required to visit the demonstration plot during crop season in the model villages \non continuous and regular basis to have proper feedback on the impact of the SHC \ntechnology from the farmers and extension workers. \n \n7. Reporting and Documentation \n \n The district level Nodal Officers organizing the demonstrations are required to \nproperly tabulate, correlate and compile the results of all the demonstrations pertaining to \ndifferent model villages under their control and report to the States/Uts Nodal Officers, who \nin turn will compile the results at state level detailing the overall decrease or increase in \nthe individual fertiliser consumption, increase in crop yields, net gain in income etc. The \nfinal report along with States/Uts Nodal Officer’s critical remarks may be transmitted to \nINM Division, DAC&FW, New Delhi.  \n A success story in local languages may be published in the local news papers and \nin popular & widely circulated extension journals of the state and short video film produced \nand telecasted for the benefits of other farmers. \n \n \n \n******************** \n \n \n \nAnnexure-I \nBase Line Survey for Model Villages programme - (2019-20) \nState____________ District______________Block_____________Village_____________ \nModel Village at a Glance \nAdministrative Domain \nTotal geographical area \n \n \nTotal no. of families / \nHouseholds  \n \n \nDemographic Profile \nTotal population \nMale \nFemale \nFemale / 1000 male \nSchedule Castes \nSchedule Tribes \nPopulation density / km2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal work force \nFarmers (%) \nAgricultural labour (%)                \nWorkers in house hold industry \n(%) \nOther workers (%) \n \n \n \n \n \nLand use and Agriculture \nGross cultivated area \n(ha) \nNet cultivated area (ha) \nNet irrigated area (ha) \nSource of irrigation   \nForest area (ha) \nCropping intensity (%) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMajor crop rotations followed \n \nAverage yield of major \ncrops(q/ha) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo. of operational holdings  \nMarginal (< 1 ha) \nSmall (1-2 ha) \nSemi-Medium (2-4 ha) \n \n \n \nMedium (4-10 ha) \nLarge (> 10ha) \nTotal holdings \n \n \n \n  Fertiliser Consumption (Quintals) \nNitrogenous fertilizers \nPhosphorus fertilizers \nPotassium fertilizers \nSecondary & \nMicronutrients (S, Zn, \nMn, Fe, Cu, & B) \nAverage Fertilizers \napplication (NPK) kg / ha \n \nAverage Organic Manures \napplication (q/ha) \nAverage Bio-fertilizers  \napplication (kg/ha) \nAverage Gypsum or Lime \napplication if any (q/ha) \nNo. of fertiliser retailers i.e. \nfertilizers POS \n \nKrishi Vigyan Kendra’s (KVK’s) & Soil Testing Laboratory (STL)  \nNearest KVK (place & \nkms) \n \nNearest STL (place & kms) \nVillage level STL established  \n \nAnimal Husbandry \nTotal No. of Cattle    \n \nPoultry \n \nEconomic Infrastructure & Transportation (place & km) \nNearest Post Office  \nNearest Bank  \nNearest Agri.

Intercultivation \n A pre- emergence weedicide such as Linuran @ 0.5 kg/ha in 900 litres of water, \nor Nifen 2 l/ha in 900 litres of water is sprayed just after planting and immediately \nthe field is irrigated. \n Twenty to twenty-five days after planting, the stolens arise from the lower nodes. \n These stolens bend downwards and enter into the soil and at their tips tuberisation \nstarts 35 days after planting. \n This is the stage when the plants are to be earthed up. Immediately after earthing \nup, the field has to be irrigated. The earthing prevents greening effect of sunrays \non exposed tuber which actually affects market quality of tubers. \n It also prevents frost damage to tubers. The second earthing up is given 30 days \nafter first earthing up. \n Drip irrigation is given just after planting to keep optimum soil moisture. Further \ndrip irrigation is given everyday @ 1 hour per day depending upon the soil type \nand climate. \n \nCrop at vegetative stage \nv. Harvesting and post harvest management \n Irrigation is withheld 15 - 20 days ahead of the normal harvest date and haulms \nare removed. It facilitates prolonged storage life through skin hardening of tubers. \n Tubers are dug out 20 days after the haulms removal and heaped under shade. \n Then the tubers are sorted out by removal of cut, bruised and pest and disease \nattacked tubers. \n The tubers are graded according to size such as big, medium, small and miniature \nsized. \n \nCrop at tuber development stage \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTURMERIC \n \ni.

    "question": "uent to 01.02.2019, there could be change in ownership due to the \nfollowing reasons:- \n \ni) \nTransfer of ownership due to inheritance resulting out of death of the land \nowner.  In such cases the family of the successors would be entitled to the \nbenefits, if otherwise eligible as per scheme guidelines. \nii) \nIn cases of cultivable land transferred to other persons through Sale Deed, \nPartition Deed, Gift Deed, etc., the transferee will not be eligible under the \nScheme as he/she was not the land owner as on 01.02.2019.  However, in \nsuch cases even the transferor of the land will become ineligible if the \nfamily of the transferor does not have any cultivable land subsequent to \nsuch a transfer. \n \n5.3.4 The State Governments have to put in place the administrative mechanism \nbased on their existing land revenue administrative regime to take care of formulations.  \nThere should be clear cut responsibility entrusted to the officials responsible for \nundertaking mutation of land records. \n \ni) \nIn case of correction of land record for recording land ownership accrued \ndue to inheritance before 01.12.2018 then the eligibility of the family under \nthe scheme shall be properly determined as per the conditions of the \nscheme. The procedure for determining the eligibility as per the exclusion \nclauses shall remain as prescribed. \nii) \nIn case of transfer of land ownership due to inheritance, reassessing the \neligibility of the family under PM KISAN -  If the family is no longer eligible, \nthen the same have to be updated in the PM KISAN portal so that the \nbenefits can be discontinued subsequently.  In case of family of the \ndeceased land owner is still eligible (where spouse or the minor children",
    "answer": "re having cultivable land and eligible as per guidelines), the details of the \nnew beneficiary alongwith other details with the fresh self-declarations \nhave \nto \nbe \nprovided \nto \nthe \nconcerned \nauthorities \nfor \ninclusion/modifications so that the benefit to the survivors of the family can \ncontinue. \niii) \nSubsequent to inheritance if the families of the inheritors also become \nfreshly eligible under PM Kisan then all the details of the freshly eligible \nfamilies have to be incorporated in the database so that benefits start \naccruing to such families from the date when inheritance became \noperational. \niv) \nIn case of transfer of cultivable land for reasons other than death after \n01.02.2019, the officials have to reassess the eligibility of the transferor \nand decide whether the benefits have to be stopped or not and intimate \n5 \n \nthe authorities so that the PM KISAN portal can be updated.  Transferees \nare not entitled for any benefits under PM KISAN in such cases. \n \n5.4 \nThe beneficiaries, whose names are uploaded on PM-Kisan Portal by the \nState/UT Government in a particular 4-month period / trimester, shall be entitled to \nreceive benefit for that trimester and for further installments pertaining to the \nsubsequent trimesters for that financial year. \n \n5.5 \nIn some of the North Eastern States, the land ownership rights are community \nbased and it might not be possible to assess the quantum of Land holder farmers. In \nsuch States an alternate implementation mechanism for eligibility of the farmers will be \ndeveloped and approved by the Committee of Union Ministers of Ministry of \nDevelopment of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Union \nAgriculture Minister and concerned State Chief Ministers or their Ministerial \nrepresentative, based on the proposal by the concerned North Eastern States.  \n \n5.5.1 For identification of bona fide beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Manipur, the \nfollowing proposal of Government of Manipur was considered and approved by the \nCommittee: \n \n“The certificate issued by the Village authority, namely, the Chairman/Chief, authorizing \nany tribal family to cultivate a piece of land, may be accepted. Such certification of \nvillage Chairman/Chief shall be authenticated by the concerned sub-divisional officers. \nAll the exclusions under the Operational Guidelines will be applicable.” \n \n5.6 \nFor identification of bona fide beneficiary under PM-Kisan Scheme in Jharkhand, \nthe following proposal of Government of Jharkhand was considered and approved by \nthe Committee:  \n“The farmer will be asked to submit ‘Vanshavali (Lineage)’ linked to the entry of land \nrecord comprising his \\ her ancestor’s name giving a chart of successor. This lineage \nchart shall be submitted before the Gram Sabha for calling objections. After approval of \nthe Gram Sabha, the village level \\ circle level revenue officials will verify and \nauthenticate the Vanshawali and possession of holding. This authenticated list of \nfarmers after due verification of succession chart shall be countersigned by the District \nlevel revenue authority. Farmers’ names, subject to the exclusion criterion after \nfollowing the aforementioned process, shall be uploaded on the PM-Kisan portal along \nwith other required details for this disbursement of benefit under the scheme.”  \n6. \nStrategy for Implementation  \n \n6.1 \nThe States shall prepare database of eligible beneficiary landholder farmer \nfamilies in the villages capturing the Name, Age, Gender, Category (SC/ST), Aadhaar \nNumber, Bank Account Number and the Mobile Number of the beneficiaries. \nResponsibility of identifying the landholder farmer family eligible for benefit under the \nscheme shall be of the State/UT Government. In case of beneficiaries in States of \nAssam, Meghalaya, J&K where Aadhaar number has not been issued to most of the \ncitizens, Aadhaar number shall be collected for those beneficiaries where it is available \nand for others alternate prescribed documents such as Driving Licence, Voters’ ID Card, \n6 \n \nNREGA Job Card, or any other identification documents issued by Central/State/UT \nGovernments or their authorities, etc. can be collected for identity verification purposes. \nThese three States have been exempted from the requirement of Aadhaar number till \n31.3.2020. In the meantime these States will complete Aadhaar enrolment. States/UTs \nshall ensure that there is no duplication of the payment transferred to eligible families.  \nSpeedy reconciliation in case of wrong/incomplete bank details of the beneficiary should \nbe ensured. \n \n6.2  \nFor the purpose of exclusion States have to take a self declaration from the \nbeneficiaries as detailed in par 4.2 above. In the said self declaration taken by the \nStates/UT Governments an undertaking should also be included wherein the consent of \nthe beneficiaries should be taken for using the Aadhaar number for verification of his \neligibility for the scheme with the concerned agencies.  This consent of the beneficiary \nshould be “to agree that the department responsible for implementation of the Pradhan \nMantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana in Union Government or the State Government / \nUnion Territory Administration can use the beneficiary Aadhaar number and other \ninformation provided in the declaration to verify the eligibility of the beneficiary for \nscheme as per extant scheme guidelines with the concerned agencies”. \n \n6.3 \nThe existing land-ownership system in the concerned State/UT will be used for \nidentification of beneficiaries. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance that the land \nrecords are clear and updated. Further, State/UT Governments would also expedite the \nprogress of digitization of the land records and linking the same with Aadhaar as well as \nbank details of the beneficiaries.  \n \n6.4 \nThe lists of eligible beneficiaries would be published at the village level. Farmers’ \nfamilies who are eligible but have been excluded should be provided an opportunity to \nrepresent their case. \n \n7. \nReview, Monitoring and Grievance Redressal Mechanism \n \n7.1 \nThere will be stratified review/monitoring mechanism at National, State and \nDistrict Level. At the National level, the Review Committee will be headed by Cabinet \nSecretary. The States shall notify the State and District Level Review / Monitoring \nCommittee.  \n \n7.2 \nThe States shall also notify State and District Level Grievance Redressal \nMonitoring Committees for looking into all the grievances related to implementation of \nthe scheme. Any grievances or complaints which are received should be disposed off \non merit preferably within two weeks time.  \n \n8. \nSetting up of Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) \n \n8.1 \nA Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) at Central level will be set up in DAC&FW in the \nform of a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. This PMU shall \nbe tasked with the responsibility of overall monitoring of the scheme and shall be \nheaded by Chief Executive Officer (CEO). PMU shall also undertake publicity campaign \n(Information, Education and Communication-IEC).  \n7 \n \n \n8.2 \nEach \nState/UT \nGovernment \nwill \ndesignate \na \nNodal \nDepartment \nfor \nimplementation of the scheme and coordinating with Central Government with regard to \nimplementation of Income Support Scheme.  \n \n8.3 \nOn the lines of PMU at central level, States/UTs may consider setting up \ndedicated Project Monitoring Units at State/UT Level. 0.125% for the amount of \ninstallments transferred to beneficiaries can be transferred by Central Government to \nState / UT Government to cover the expenditure on their PMUs, if established and for \nmeeting other related administrative expenses including cost to be incurred for \nprocurement of stationary, field verification, filling of prescribed formats, their \ncertification and its uploading as well as incentive for field functionaries, publicity, etc. \nStates/UTs will furnish the details of the account to which Administrative Charges are \ncredited by the Central Government. The administrative charges payable to the \nStates/UTs will be provided by Government of India based on the volume of work and \nthe number of beneficiaries. \n \n9. \nPM Kisan Portal for implementation of the scheme (Beneficiary Details \nuploading by State) \n \n9.1 \nBeneficiaries under the scheme are to be identified by the respective State and \nUnion Territory. The details of farmers are being maintained by the States/UTs either in \nelectronic form or in manual register. To make integrated platform available in the \ncountry to assist in benefit transfer, a platform named PM-Kisan Portal available at \nURL (http://pmkisan.nic.in) has been be launched for uploading the farmers’ details at \na single web-portal in a uniform Structure. \n9.2 \nThe PM-Kisan Portal has been created with the following objectives - \ni) \nTo provide verified and single source of truth on farmers’ details at the portal. \nii) \nTimely assistance to the farmers in farm operation \niii) \nA unified e-platform for transferring of cash benefits into farmers bank account \nthrough PFMS integration. \niv) \nLocation wise availability of benefited farmers list. \nv) \nEase of monitoring across the country on fund transaction details. \n \n9.3 \nPM Kisan Portal : \nThe following farmer attributes need to be entered in the Portal: \nFarmer Attributes: (Essential): \n State, District, Sub-District/Block, Village, Farmer Name, Type of Identity –\nAadhaar Number and in case Aadhaar not available, Aadhaar enrollment number \nwith any other ID proof like Voter ID etc, Gender, Category, IFSC Code, Bank \nAccount Number. \n \nFarmer Attributes (Optional): \nFather name, Address, Mobile Number, Date of Birth/Age, Farm-Size in Hectare, \nSurvey Number, Khasra Number \n8 \n \n \n Optional attributes such as Mobile number can be utilized for SMS alerts. Other \noptional attributes may be used for purpose of future requirement.  However, \nthese attributes are not essential for purpose of transfer of money. \n \nThese attributes are illustrated on PM KISAN Portal http://pmkisan.nic.in as \nfollows \n \n \n9.4 \nThere are 3 ways through which a State/UT can onboard on the PM Kisan Portal: \n(a) \nIf a State/UT has village/district wise list of farmers, they may upload the \nsame in a  \npre-defined format and with the help of local NIC State Unit. \nFollowing Farmer  Attributes need to be entered:  \n \n(b) \nSome existing data of farmers is already available on the PM-Kisan Portal \nwhich will be visible on selection of States/Districts/Village. States/UTs \nwhich do not have their own list may use this village-wise list of farmers as \nprovided on the portal and edit the same to finalize the farmers’ list. For \nthis the correction window shall be available at PM Kisan portal for \nauthorized users of District and Block officials.   \n(c) \nIf States/UTs want to make fresh entry of a farmer, provision is there for \nregistration of these farmers in a defined and standardized format. \n9.5  \nDatabases of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Soil Health Cards, \nSocio Economic and Caste Census (SECC), can also be utilized for this purpose.   \nState/UT wise status of number of farmer records shall be available at \nhttp://pmkisan.nic.in. \n9 \n \n \n9.6  \nRecords preparation process through PM-KISAN Portal: \n \n1. State admin and District admin need to be identified for creation of login \ncredentials or approval of login credentials in case of self registration by \nDistrict and Block/Tehsil/Taluka officials. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2. Farmers list as available on the portal shall be available at Block/Tehsil/Taluka \nlevel official’s login.  \n \n3. Search facility will also be available to get details on Farmers by Name, \nAadhaar Number or Mobile Number in case PM-KISAN Portal data is being \nused. Facility to add new Farmers details shall be available, if details are not \nfound in the list. \n \n4. The verified list shall be e-signed by the District level or block/tehsil/taluka \nlevel officials as the case may be. The exclusion categories specified in \nscheme guidelines also need to be taken care before e-signing the verified \nfarmers list. \n \n5. The States Nodal Officer shall submit a district wise e-Signed list of farmers to \nthe Program Division of DAC&FW through PM-Kisan Portal. \n \n10 \nModalities for transfer of benefit \n \n10.1 This financial benefit of Rs.6000/- per year is to be released to the eligible \nfarmers in three installments of Rs.2000/- each every 4-month / trimester, i.e. April-July, \nAugust-November and December-March.  \n \n10.2 The Scheme is being implemented through an Aadhaar linked electronic data \nbase containing details of all members of the families of the farmers whose names \nappear in the land records. For transfer of the financial benefits to the eligible farmers, \nAadhaar number shall be collected for all beneficiaries, since payment of all installments \npertaining to the trimester August-December, 2019 onwards shall be done only on the \nbasis of Aadhaar seeded data base. However, exemption has been to the States of \nAssam, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir from the requirement of Aadhaar number \nand Aadhaar seeded database under the scheme till 31.3.2020. In the meantime these \nSTATE ADMIN\nDISTRICT ADMIN\nDISTRICT ADMIN\nDISTRICT ADMIN\nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \nBLOCK\nUSER \n10 \n \nStates will complete Aadhaar enrolment so that subsequent installments are released \non the basis of Aadhaar seeded data only. States / UTs shall ensure that there is no \nduplication of the payment transferred to eligible families.  \n  \n10.3 The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges \nshall \nbe \nreleased \nfrom \nGovernment \nof \nIndia \nto \nthe \nStates’ \ndesignated \naccount/mechanism.  The benefit shall be transferred by Government of India to the \nbeneficiaries through a mechanism wherein district wise beneficiaries’ lists shall be \ncertified and uploaded by the States/UTs and the funds will be electronically transferred \nvia State Notional Account [similar to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme (MNREGS)] to the beneficiaries’ bank account on the basis of their \naccount numbers and IFSC code. However, where the states verify that Aadhaar linked \naccounts are not the loan accounts of beneficiaries, the Aadhaar linked payment system \ncan be adopted. However, from the August-December, 2019 trimester onwards the \nStates shall have to ensure Aadhaar linked bank accounts of the beneficiaries, except in \ncase of Assam, Meghalaya and Jammu & Kashmir, which have been given exemption \ntill the 31st March, 2020. For ease of implementation the States may consider assigning \nthe job of sponsoring bank for the scheme to the same bank being used by concerned \nState for MGNREGS. \n \n10.4 The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges \nshall \nbe \nreleased \nfrom \nGovernment \nof \nIndia \nto \nthe \nState \ndesignated \naccount/mechanism. Detailed modalities for transfer of funds are as under: \n \n(a) \nThe amount due to the beneficiaries under the scheme, is to be paid directly into \ntheir bank account through the mechanism of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The \namount will flow to the account of the beneficiaries, held in destination banks, through \nthe accredited bank of Department and sponsoring bank of the State/UT, using PFMS \nportal. The destination bank can be a Schedule Bank, Post office, Rural Bank, \nCooperative Bank or any other Financial Institution.   \n \n(b) \nThe important steps to be taken by State/UT Governments and Union \nGovernments, for timely payment into the beneficiary account are listed below: \nA. State/UT Government: \ni. \nState/UT Governments are to identify the beneficiaries and upload the \nbeneficiary details on the web portal of the scheme.  \n \nii. \nCorrectness of beneficiary details is to be ensured by State/UT Governments. \nFurther, speedy reconciliation in case of wrong/incomplete bank details of the \nbeneficiary should be ensured. \n \niii. \nFor facilitating payment, Fund Transfer Order (FTO,) for the total amount in a \nbatch of beneficiaries, is to be signed by State/UT, on the web portal of the \nscheme. \n \niv. \nState/UT Governments are also required to identify a bank in each State/UT and \ndesignate it as sponsoring bank for this scheme. States may consider \n11 \n \ndesignating the same bank for use for MNRGES for sponsoring bank for this \nschemes. \n \nv. \nThe bank to be designated as sponsoring bank, is to have well developed IT \nsystems with the capabilities of integration with web portal of the scheme and \nPublic Financial Management System (PFMS). \n \nvi. \nDetails of sponsoring bank along with IFSC code and bank account number in \nwhich funds are to be transferred are to be provided to the Department.  \n \nvii. \nStates/UT Governments are to authorise the sponsoring bank to directly transmit \nthe amount received under the scheme to destination banks, having beneficiary \naccount. \n \nviii. \nThe sponsoring bank is to transmit the funds to destination bank soon after the \nsame are received by it.  \n \nB. Union  Government: \nI. \nThe Programme Division in the Department is to issue Sanction Order on the \nbasis of FTOs received from States/UTs. \nII. \nThe beneficiary account is to be credited periodically after the issuance of the \nSanction Order. \nIII. \nBeneficiary would be intimated about credit of amount to his account by Short \nMessaging Service (SMS).  \nIV. \nThe confirmation of credit to the beneficiary account would be received  back by \nthe Department on the day next to the day of credit to the beneficiary account. \nV. \nFailed/unsuccessful transactions would be reported back by the banking system  \nto the Department, on the day next to the day of reporting of the successful \ntransactions, along with amount involved. \nVI. \nDetails of failed transactions would be made available to States/UTs for further \nverification of beneficiary details and reprocessing. \n10.5 The beneficiary lists would be displayed at Panchayats to ensure greater \ntransparency and information. Further, States/UTs would notify the sanction of benefit to \nthe beneficiary through system generated SMS.  In cases of complaints/grievances \nemanating subsequent to publication of beneficiary list, the same should be addressed \nand remedial action taken expeditiously. Efforts should be undertaken by State/UT \nGovernments to ensure checking for around 5% of the beneficiary for the eligibility \nduring the year.  \n \n11. \nValidity of the list of beneficiaries \n \n \nThe list of beneficiaries identified by States/UTs shall be valid for one year. However, \nStates/UTs can upload names of eligible beneficiaries who have been identified \nsubsequently. States/UTs should also implement a mechanism to ensure revision of the \nname of the beneficiary in case of mutation /changes in the land record after uploading \nlist on the portal for updation of the eligible beneficiary details for such lands as per \nabove para 5.3. \n*******",

Introduction \nSoil is a living medium which serves as a natural nutrient source for growth of plants. The components of \nsoils are mineral, organic matter, water and air, the proportions of which vary and together form a system \nfor plant growth. Soils are studied and classified according to their use. Soil surveys are made for Natural \nResource Management and soil testing is conducted as part of Fertilizer Use and Management. \n2.2. Nutrient Status of Soils \n2.2.1. In India, intensive agriculture has resulted in impressive growth in food grain production powered \nby improved varieties of seeds, application of fertilizers and assured irrigation. The existing NPK \nconsumption ratio in the country is skewed at 8.2:3.2:1 (2012-13) as against the preferred ratio of \n4:2:1. A great variability is observed in fertiliser consumption among States from 250 kg / ha in \nPunjab, 212 kg / ha in Bihar, 207 kg / ha in Haryana to 4.8 kg / ha in Nagaland and 2 kg / ha in \nArunachal Pradesh in nutrient form during 2012-13. However, imbalanced application of fertilisers \nhave caused deficiency of primary nutrients (i.e. NPK), secondary nutrients (such as sulphur), and \nmicronutrients (boron, zinc, copper etc.), in most parts of country. \n2.2.2. Site specific nutrient management involving soil test based application of fertilizers is critical to \nenhance fertilizer use efficiency. A fertilizer not suitable to a soil type can be called as an incorrect \nfertilizer used for that soil, and in such case, fertilizer consumption ceases to be efficient to increase \nproduction. Different types of fertilizers are required to be used in acidic/ alkaline soils. Fertigation \ninvolving the use of water soluble fertilizers through drip and sprinkler irrigation is expected to give \nbetter use efficiency for water and fertilizers. Therefore, it is necessary to promote use of required \nsources of plant available forms of nutrients coupled with use of soil amendments in acidic/ alkaline \nsoils so as to enhance soil nutrient availability. In India, in general, blanket fertilizer \nrecommendations are followed for N, P & K which rarely matches soil fertility need, and often \nignoring secondary and micro nutrients, in various cropping systems followed by small and \nmarginal farmers. Keeping in view the above facts, Government of India is promoting integrated \nnutrient management (INM)i.e. balanced and judicious use of chemical fertilizers, along with bio \nfertilizers and locally available organic manures based on soil testing to maintain soil health and \ncrop productivity. \n2.3. Soil Testing Programme \n2.3.1. Soil testing programme was started in India in the year 1955-56 with the setting up of 16 Soil \nTesting Laboratories (STLs) under \"Determination of Soil Fertility and Fertilizer Use\" programme. \nTotal nutrient content varies from soil to soil, and plant available forms of nutrients are chemically \ndetermined in soil testing laboratories. Till 1980, the laboratories generally used to analyze for pH, \ntexture, electrical conductivity, organic carbon (as an index of available N), and available P and K. \n2.3.2. The process of setting-up of soil testing laboratories has continued with financial support from \nGovernment of India, year after year. In 2012-13, the soil analyzing capacity in the country was \n128.31 lakh soil samples per annum. The soil testing facility is provided by State Governments to \nthe farmers free of cost or with some nominal fee. \n15\n16 \n \n \n \n2.3.3. In view of the critical role played by soil testing in ensuring balanced and efficient use of fertilizers, \nstates have been advised from time to time to enhance and improve their soil testing programme. The \nState Governments are preparing district wise and also block wise fertility maps. Some states have \nprepared village level fertility maps too. Other states have introduced soil testing on a ten hectare \ngrid basis and are issuing soil health cards. Some state governments have started \ncomputerization of soil test data, which the farmers can access online and advisory can be sent \nthrough SMS to their mobile phones. Several states including Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, \nKarnataka and Uttar Pradesh have made commendable progress in soil testing programme. They have \ntaken up expansion of testing facilities, popularized the soil test analysis in a campaign mode and used \ninformation technology in delivering soil nutrient status and appropriate recommendations \nto farmers. \n2.3.4. As seen from above, no uniform norms are followed in the country for soil analysis and distribution of \nSoil Health Cards. There is also a need to devise a mechanism to issue soil health cards every 3 years in \nrespect of all landholdings in order to capture the soil fertility changes occurring due to plant uptake \nor other natural causes. More attention is required on the follow up measures on the soil nutrient \ndeficiencies identified in soil health cards. Along with soil health cards that diagnose fertility related \nconstraints small and marginal farmers need technical support to apply site specific fertilizer \nrecommendations. Therefore, Soil Health Card scheme is proposed for periodic testing of soil and to \nrecommend nutrient management. \n2.3.5. The scheme will be implemented in all the States to promote the soil testing services, issue of Soil \nHealth Cards and development of Nutrient Management Practices. The scheme on Soil Health will be \nimplemented in accordance with the guidelines described here under. Cost of the interventions proposed \nunder the scheme will be shared in the ratio of 75:25 between the Central and the State Governments. \n2.4. Scheme Objectives \nObjectives of scheme Soil Health Card are as follows: \n2.4.1 To issue soil health cards every 3 years, to all farmers of the country, so as to provide a basis to \naddress nutrient deficiencies in fertilization practices, \n2.4.2 To strengthen functioning of Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) through capacity building, \ninvolvement of agriculture students and effective linkage with Indian Council of Agricultural \nResearch (ICAR) / State Agricultural Universities (SAUs). \n2.4.3 To diagnose soil fertility related constraints with standardized procedures for sampling uniformly \nacross states and analysis and design taluqa / block level fertilizer recommendations in targeted \ndistricts, \n2.4.4 To develop and promote soil test based nutrient management in the districts for enhancing nutrient use \nefficiency, \n2.4.5 To build capacities of district and state level staff and of progressive farmers for promotion of \nnutrient management practices. \n2. 5. Scheme Components \n2.5.1 Issue of soil health cards: Aims at periodic distribution of Soil health cards to all the farmers to \nprovide information on soil fertility along with recommendations for application of plant \nnutrients. \n2.5.2 Training for soil analysis: One-week hands-on orientation training to soil chemists, students/JRFs for \nsoil analysis and fertilizer recommendation in the batches of 20 participants will be organized at \nSAUs/ICAR Institutes. \n2.5.3 Financial assistance for package of nutrient recommendations : Aims to provide financial assistance \n16 \n17 \n \n \n \nto farmers to apply corrective measures for nutrient deficiencies and popularizing balance and\nintegrated nutrient management practices for their cropping systems. \n2.5.4 Capacity building and regular monitoring and evaluation: Orientation for technical and line staff \nalong with SAU/ ICAR institutions will be conducted by states. \n2.5.5 Mission Management: For mission management, Project Management Team (PMT) will be \nconstituted. \n2.6. Ongoing programmes on Soil Health Management \nSoil Testing Programmes are also being implemented through National Mission for  \nSustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). They would continue to be \nimplemented subject to these guidelines. The soil testing techniques & INM practices developed under \nthis mission will be implemented in all the DAC programme. \n2.7. Expected Outcome \nThe Scheme envisages: \n2.7.1 Distribution of Soil Health Cards to all the farmers in a round of every three years to promote Soil \nHealth Management. \n2.7.2 It will promote balanced and judicious use of plant nutrients. \n2.7.3 Promotion of integrated nutrient system is expected to reduce the consumption of chemical \nfertilizers by 20%. \n2.7.4 The productivity of selected crops is expected to increase significantly. v. The demand for organic \nsources of plant nutrient like bio-fertilizers, organic manure, vermi-compost, slow release \nnitrogenous fertilizer like neem/sulphur coated urea will increase, which in turn improve the soil \nfertility as well nutrient use efficiency. \n2.8. Interventions \nInterventions proposed for the Scheme includes development of modalities for soil sample collection \nalong with standard sampling norms, quality control in the soil analysis, training of sampling staff and \nSTL personnel, intensive use of ICT for database management for faster delivery of soil health cards in \nPPP mode and popularizing soil test based INM through field demonstrations/field days. \n2. 9 Component 1: The Soil Health Card \n2.9.1 Soil health card is field-specific detailed report of soil fertility status and other important soil \nparameters that affect crop productivity.

However, static and mobile labs will preferred option. Mini-labs will be promoted when \nthey can analyse both macro and micro-nutrients and are needed to meet contingency arising from time, \nreach of location or such other situation(s). \n3.1.2 Norms for Assistance- In case of static STLs 60% of the project cost, subject to a limit of Rs.45 lakh, \nwill be provided as subsidy for purchase of machinery & equipment, chemicals & glass wares, miscellaneous \nlaboratory articles and contingencies as per indicative list at Annexure II. \nIn case of mobile STLs, financial assistance from DAC shall be 60% of the project cost subject to a maximum \nof Rs. 45 lakh per Mobile STL as per indicative list at Annexure III. \nIn case of Mini-lab, financial assistance shall be 60% of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 45,000 \nper Mini-lab as per indicative list at Annexure IX. \nThe suggested list of equipments can be changed in special circumstances only with the specific approval of\nINM Division. \n3.1.3 Expected Outcome- It is expected that each of these static, mobile & mini labs can analyse NPK and \nmicronutrients. The expected annual capacity to test both macro and micro-nutrients of static STL at 10,000 \nsamples, of mobile STL at 5,000 samples and that of mini-lab at 3,000 samples should be optimally utilized.  \n39 \n40 \n \n \n \n \nIn case of Labs with ICP, such capacity will get enhanced to atleast 1 lac samples per annum and should \nbe used accordingly.  \n \n3.1.4 Involvement of Private Sector- Whereas normally Soil Testing labs will be set up by state \ngovernment through state agencies, it is expected that state government will encourage \ninvolvement of other agencies such as Private Companies associated with Agriculture Extension\nin some way such as Fertilizer Companies, Agriclinics, NGOs, Cooperative Societies and private \nentrepreneurs(Agri-preneurs). The State Governments will need to announce clear guidelines for \ninvolving these private sector agencies in the operation and management of these Soil Testing labs. \nState Governments are encouraged to announce innovative PPP Guidelines for involvement of \nPrivate sector for running of these Labs. The guidelines should, inter alia, clearly define all the \nterms and conditions including the soil testing charges to be charged from farmers and the \nMOU/Agreement to be signed with these private agencies, clear cut monitorable targets. State \nGovernments will monitor and review performance of these private sector labs periodically. \n3.2. Strengthening of Existing Soil Testing Laboratories \n3.2.1 At present, there are 1087 soil testing laboratories (930 STLs and 157 MSTLs) working in the \ncountry having annual analyzing capacity of about 12 million soil samples. Many of the existing\nSTLs do not have facilities for micronutrient analysis and the existing capacities of analysing NPK\nalso is not being fully utilised. A onetime grant shall be provided to create facilities for analysis of\nmicro-nutrients such as Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese, Boron, etc. Atleast 125 existing STLs will \nbe strengthened during the 12th Five Year Plan period. \n3.2.2 Norms for assistance- Rs. 30 lakhs per/lab for creating micronutrient analysis facilities through \npurchase of Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrophotometer ICP)/Atomic Absorption \nSpectrometer (AAS), its accessories with required chemicals and glassware of standard quality as \nper indicative list at Annexure-IV. \n3.2.3 Normally Existing STLs/MSTLs working under the control of the State Governments/UTs will \nbe eligible for strengthening. For strengthening of STLs having no micro-nutrient analysis \nfacility, performance assessment should be made keeping in view the existing staff before any \nassistance is given. Only working STLs should be supported. The State Government should \ncarefully study the existing performance level of the STL and whether it requires any process \nchange to achieve higher efficiencies. Moreover, a system of bench-marking should clearly be \nput in place. State Governments are encouraged to announce clearly defined and transparent \nguidelines for taking help of private sector as defined in para 1.4 above for operation and \nmanagement of existing STL and MSTL, along with strengthening under the scheme. \n \n40 \n \n41 \n \n \n \n3.3 \nCapacity Building through training of STL staff/extension officers/ farmers and field \ndemonstration/ workshops etc. on Soil health management/INM/balanced use of fertilizers \n3.3.1 Training Programme for Staff \nThe training programme to be organized for STL staff and field functionaries on Balanced Use of \nFertilizers will be a two day programme.

    "question": "ueries. \n3.3.5.  State Governments may implement this component though any of the selected agencies such as \nICAR institute/SAIs/KVK/Agriculture Department/State agency/Fertilizer Industry or may also \ninvolve any agriculture graduate or progressive farmer in its implementation.  The number of \nprograms will be decided by the INM division based on proposal received from states and UTs.  \nDetails of Norms for assistance and duration have been given in Annexure V. \n3.3.6. GOI or state Government will organize or assist organization of regional and national \nworkshop/seminar/exhibition through central agency or state agencies for promotion of Soil \nHealth Management, Integrated Nutrient management or Balanced use of fertilizers. \n3.4 \nCreation of Data Bank for site specific Balanced Use of Fertiliser \n3.4.1 Objective For promoting balanced use of fertilizers, it is essential to maintain region specific and \nlocation specific data on soil fertility.  As on today, there is no systematic data or system available \nin the country for recommending site- specific nutrient requirement and delineation of secondary",
    "answer": "nd micronutrient deficiencies.  It is proposed to create a National Data Bank. \n3.4.2. State Governments can implement this intervention by any agency of their choice such as ICAR \ninstitute/SAUs/National Informatics Centre etc. or even private sector, but the proposal should \nspecifically cover an action plan for the use of this data for educating farmers.  Transparent \nguidelines for selection of Private sector will need to be in place for approval of the proposal. \n3.5 Adoption of village by STLs (maximum 10 villages per STL) through Frontline Field \nDemonstration (FFD) \n3.5.1 Objective  \nFor confidence building of farmers about usefulness of balanced use of fertilizers, it is essential that \nSTLs’ recommendations are effectively demonstrated in villages.  It is proposed to adopt 8000 \nvillages by 800 Soil Testing Laboratories to conduct frontline field demonstration on balanced use \n42 \n \n43 \n \n \n \nof fertilizers. These 800 STLs shall be chosen by the State Government, a list will be sent to GOI \nalong with the proposal. \n3.5.2. Around 10 farmers belonging to the adopted village should be selected. A field day shall invariably \nbe arranged for farmers of the same or nearby villages. Subject matter specialists should explain \nthe requirement and usefulness of soil test based fertilization and the importance of soil \namendments. \n3.5.3. Norms for Assistance-Rs. 20,000 per FFD as per the details at Annexure VI. \n3.6 Preparation of Digital District Soil Maps and Global Positioning System (GPS) based Soil \nFertility Monitoring \n3.6.1. Objectives \nLack of GPS based district soil fertility maps is the major hindrance in adopting balanced use of \nfertilizers. During 11th Plan IISS, Bhopal was entrusted the work of preparation of fertility maps of \n171 districts in 19 major States. It is proposed to prepare digital district soil maps and GPS based \nsoil fertility monitoring system in remaining agricultural districts during the 12th Five Year Plan. \n3.6.2. State Governments/SAUs/ICAR Institutes/National Informatics Centre/KVKs or other \ncentral/state Government agency can be associated for implementation of this project. \n3.6.3 Norms for Assistance will be restricted to around Rs. 6.00 lakh per district. \n3.7. Portable Soil Testing Kits for Balanced Use of Fertilizers \nFor faster and on-farm testing of soil nutrient for balanced use of fertilizers assistance to State \nGovernment subject to maximum of Rs. 0.15 lakh/per kit will be provided. It is proposed to \ndistribute 3000 soil testing kits to field functionaries during 12th plan period. Preference will be \ngiven for kits having micro nutrient facility. Technical suitability of kit will be decided in \nconsultation with IARI, New Delhi. \n3.8.

Assistance will limited to 50% of the cost of requisite \nnutrients subject to a maximum of Rs. 500 per hectare. \n43\n \n44 \n \n \n \n3.9 \nStrengthening of fertilizer quality control system \n3.9.1. Strengthening/Up gradation of the existing State Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories \ni. \nIn order to check the quality of the fertilizers sold in the country, at present there are 74 \nFQCL working under the control of different State Governments. Since quality testing \nis a statutory requirement under the Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), it is imperative to \nmaintain all the instruments and equipment and to ensure supply of quality chemicals \nand glasswares for the analysis. This requires time-to-time upgradation and \nreplacement of the equipment. Many of the State Laboratories are also facing acute \nfinancial problem to maintain these facilities. Therefore, in order to maintain the high \nstandard of analysis potential, it is proposed to upgrade and strengthen the existing \nFQCLs. \nii. \nEligible Agencies-FQCLs under State Governments. Assistance will be provided to \nonly those State laboratories, which are functional and working well and there will be \nno recurring liability on the part of the Central Government. \niii. \nNorms for Assistance-Rs.30 lakh per laboratory is to be provided for purchase of \nmachinery & equipment, chemicals, glasswares and miscellaneous laboratory articles \nas indicated Annexure VII. \n3.9.2. Setting up of new Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories by State Governments \nConsidering that the total number of dealers in the country by the end of the 12th Five \nYear Plan would be about 3.25 lakhs, the minimum requirement of fertilizer samples to \nd for ensuring quality is 6.50 lakh (to cover each dealer during kharif and rabi). The\ncapacity of existing testing facilities (1.25 lakh) is quite inadequate and is only around \n20 per cent of the requirement. It is, therefore, proposed to set up 20 new FQCLs by the \nState Governments for quality testing with annual analyzing capacity of 4000 samples each.    \ni. \nA onetime financial assistance @ Rs.75 lakh/laboratory is proposed to be provided to the State \nGovernments.  This will provide an additional annual analyzing capacity of 0.80 lakh samples. \nii. \nNo. of Laboratories to be set up – 20 new FQCLs will be set up during the 12th File Year Plan. \niii. \nNorms for Assistance-One time grant of Rs.75 lakh per laboratory shall be provided for purchase \nof machinery & equipments, chemicals, glass wares and miscellaneous laboratory articles as per \nAnnexure-VIII to create facilities for analysis of NPK, secondary and micronutrients. \n44 \n \n45 \n \n \n \nANNEXURE-I \nComponent wise Pattern of assistance (under centrally sponsored \nscheme) Soil Health components of SHM under NMSA \nSl. \nComponent \nPattern of assistance \n1. \n \nSetting up of new Mobile/Static soil testing \nlaboratories (MSTL/ SSTL) \n75% Assistance of total project cost to State \nGovt. for SSTL subject to a maximum limit of \nRs 56 lakh per SSTL/MSTL. \n2. \n \nStrengthening of existing SSTL/MSTL. \n75 % Assistance to State Govt. subject t \no a \nmaximum limit of Rs 30 lakh per MSTL/SSTL. \n3. \n \nTraining and demonstration on Soil Health \nmanagement \nTraining to STL / FTL Staff, field \nfunctionaries. \nRs.25,000/- \nper training session for 20 \nparticipants or more. \nTraining to farmers including field \ndemonstrations; \nRs. 10,000/ - per training session for 20 \nparticipants or more. \nRs. 20,000/- per Front Line Field Demonstration \n4. \n \nCreation of District \n-wise Digital soil \nfertility maps \nOne time assistance to State Govt. up to Rs.6.00 \nlakh per district subject to maximum of Rs.50 \nlakh for one State per annum. \n5. \n \nProviding Portable Soil Testing Kit to field \nlevel officers of State Govt. \nAssistance @ Rs.15,000/Kit \n6. \n \nPromotion and distribution of \nmicronutrients \n50% of cost subject to a limit of Rs. 500/ \n- \nper ha and/or Rs. 1000/- per beneficiary. \n7. \n \nStrengthening of existing Fertilizer Quality \nControl Labs (FTLs) by State Govts \nAssistance to State Govt. subject to a maximum \nlimit of Rs.30 lakh per FTL \n8. \n \nSetting up of new \nFertilizer Quality \nControl Labs by State Govts \n100% assistance to State Govt. subject to a \nmaximum limit of Rs 75 lakh per FTL. \n \n45\n \n46 \n \n \n \nANNEXURE-II  \nAdmissible items including illustrative list of equipment for setting up of Mobile/ Static Soil \nTesting Laboratory with annual analyzing capacity of 10,000 samples per annum (For \nanalyzing NPK, secondary nutrients & micronutrients in soil and water) \nList of suggestive Equipments for Static STLs \n \nS.No \nItem",

    "answer": "nd can cause losses in the range of 10-30 per cent. To overcome this issue, farmers \nuse chemical pesticides as ﬁrst line of defence and generally resort to indiscriminate \nand non-judicious use of pesticides. Presently, integrated pest and disease management \ntechnologies are being encouraged as a viable alternative to chemical pesticide. Most of \nthe farmers are not aware about the use of eco-friendly pest management approaches. \nTowards this objective, NABARD Goa Regional Oﬃce has sanctioned the project titled \n“Empowerment of Farmers through Adoption of Sustainable and Eco-Friendly \nIntegrated Pest and Diseases Management Technologies in Major Vegetables Crop \nin Goa” to ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute under ‘Farm Sector \nPromotion Fund (FSPF).\nUnder the project, ICAR-CCARI had conducted extensive awareness training \nprogramme and demonstrated sustainable management of pests and diseases in Chilli \non 23 ha area.  More than 850 farmers have been received the plan protection inputs like \nbiocontrol agents, spinosad, chitosan, sticky traps and resistant brinjal varieties. Hands \non training on use of biocontrol agents, preparation of yellow and blue sticky traps and \ngrafing technique has also been imparted to the farmers. Te project is successful in \ndemonstrating the impact in terms of reduction in pests and increase in income of the \nfarmers. I congratulate ICAR-CCARI, Goa for successfully implementing the project \nand their sincere eﬀorts towards publication of this bulletin. I am sure, this bulletin will \nbe useful to farmers and other extension personnel.\nDr. Milind R Bhirud\nGeneral Manager / Oﬃcer-in-Charge\nNABARD, Goa RO, Panaji\nMessage\n5\n \nPage No\nIntroduction \n7\nInsect pests of chilli \n8\nDiseases of chilli \n13\nTrainings and demonstrations on integrated pest and \ndisease management  technologies \n17\nPreparation of sticky traps \n42\nGrafting techniques in Brinjal \n43\nImpact of wide spread adoption of integrated pest and \ndisease management technologies in chilli \n45\nSuccess stories \n47\nSummary of achievements \n51\nRecommendations  \n52\nTable of Contents\n6\n7\nIntroduction \nVegetables play a major role in Indian agriculture as they ensure the food and \nnutritional security of the country apart from enhancing per capita income of the \nfarmers. Vegetables are cultivated in Goa on hill slopes and in paddy fallows during \nkharif and rabi season respectively. Kharif season vegetables are cucurbits (Cucumber, \nRidge gourd, Snake gourd, Bitter gourd, Pumpkin, Ivy gourd etc), bhendi, chilli etc. \nRabi season vegetables are Chilli, Brinjal, Okra, leafy vegetables and sweet potato. Tese \nvegetables are cultivated an area about 7240 ha in Goa. Te productivity of vegetable \ncrops in coastal region is reducing day by day and one of the main reasons is the losses \ncaused by insect pests and diseases. Te climatic condition in Goa is hot and humid \nwhich is favourable for the incidence of insect pests and diseases in vegetable crops \ncausing severe loss in the production and productivity and sometimes complete failure \nof crops.\nInsect pests: \nSucking insects viz., thrips Scirtothrips dorsalis, mites Polyphagotarsonemus latus and \nWhiteﬂy Bemisia tabasi are major problem in chilli and bhendi. Yield losses due to these \npest attacks may range from 25-50 %. Fruit ﬂies are the major pest in cucurbitaceous \nand cucumber being the most susceptible one. It causes damage to an extent of 30 per \ncent yield loss. Sweet potato weevil (SPW) is the major pest in sweet potato. It causes \nyield losses in the range of 25-45%.\nDiseases: \nSome of the major disease problems in the vegetables grown under coastal areas  can \nbe broadly grouped into soil borne (Bacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt, Sclerotium rot, \nRhizoctonia, Pythium, Phytophthora); foliar  (Leaf spots, leaf blight, downymildew, \npowderymildew, grey mould); bacterial (Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Erwinia) and \nViral diseases. Among these bacterial wilt in brinjal, chilli and viral diseases of chilli \nare very severe. Bacterial wilt aﬀects economically important solanaceous vegetables \n(brinjal, chilli, and tomato). Tough the above crops are grown throughout the country, \nthe severity of the disease is very high in western and southern coastal states including \nGoa (Ramesh et al., 2014). No commercial chemicals are eﬀective and majority of the \nvarieties are susceptible. In recent times, viral diseases of chilli are quite serious and \ncomplete crop loss in rabi crop is reported. \nEco-friendly integrated pest and disease management technologies in \nmajor vegetable crops of Goa\n8\nAt present, various pests in vegetables cause losses in the range of 10-30 per cent \ndepending upon the infestation severity. Farmers use pesticides as ﬁrst line of defense \nand frequently resort to indiscriminate and non-judicious use of pesticides. Vegetable \ncrops receive considerably high quantity of pesticides, and with a cropped area of three \nper cent, they consume 13 per cent of the total pesticides in the country (Nigam and \nMurthy, 2000). Te eﬀect of chemical pesticide use is more harmful in vegetables. \nHowever these measures lead to several problems such as environmental pollution, \npesticide residue in the harvested products, development of resistance/resurgence in \npests, emergence of new pests, destruction of natural enemies and pollinators, and \nincreased cost of production. Tese problems have necessitated the search for safer and \neﬀective methods of pest control, including behavioural, bio-control and botanical bio-\npesticides. Eco-friendly pest management approach has been globally accepted in order \nto minimize the indiscriminate and injudicious use of chemical pesticides for achieving \nsustainability in Agriculture. Te sustainable measures comprising of cultural practices, \nresistant/tolerant varieties, bio-control agents, botanicals and bio- pesticides. \nEco-friendly pest management approaches has become more relevant due to a number \nof advantages like safety to environment, pesticide-free food commodities and low \ninput based crop protection programme etc. Most of the farmers are not aware about \nthe use of eco-friendly pest management approaches. Te project will focus on use of \neco-friendly pest management approaches to manage the vegetable insect pests and \ndiseases and to increase the productivity. Field demonstrations and hands on trainings \nwill be provided to the farmers and other stakeholders on sticky trap preparation, \nplacement, use of entomopathogenic fungus, preparation of neem bio-pesticides, use of \nresistant varieties, biocontrol agents for managing diseases, grafing techniques for wilt \nmanagement and other eco-friendly pest management technologies. Besides trainings \nand demonstrations farmers also provided eco-friendly pest management technologies \nkit. Since the concept will reduce dependence on chemical pesticides and has relevance \nto Paramparagat krishi vikas yojana. \nObjectives of the project\n• \nTo capacity building of farmers through organization of trainings and \ndemonstrations on Integrated pest and disease management (IPDM) technologies\n• \nTo conduct ﬁeld demonstrations on use of IPDM technologies \n9\nMajor insect pests of chilli\nChilli Trips: Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood (Tysanoptera: Tripidae)\nSymptoms of damage\n• \nNymphs and adults suck the cell sap of tender leaves, buds, ﬂowers and fruits leads \nto necrosis of the cell tissues.\n• \nTe growing tip of the plant and young leaves, especially the axillary leaves, are the \nmain points of attack. \n• \nHeavy infestation of the tender shoots, buds and ﬂowers causes the leaves to crinkle \nand curl upward.\n• \nInfested tender leaves and fresh buds become brittle and thicker resulting in \ncomplete defoliation.\n• \nInfested fruits develop corky tissues\n• \nSevere infestation leads to stunted growth, malformation of tender shoots and \ncomplete crop loss\n• \nYield loss due to thrips attack may range from 25-50 %.\n10\nWhiteﬂy Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)\nSymptoms of damage\n• \nPresence of large number of nymphs and adults on the under surface of leaves\n• \nNymphs and adults suck the cell sap of leaves causes crinkling and curling of leaves\n• \nTe characteristic ﬁeld symptoms are upward curling, puckering, vein thickening, \nshortened internode length and reduced size of leaves.\n• \nSeverely aﬀected plants show stunted growth \n• \nIt excrete honey dew on which black sooty mould develops impairing the \nphotosynthetic activity of the plant. \n11\nAphids  Aphis gossypii (Glover) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer)\nSymptoms of damage\n• \nPresence of large number of nymphs and adults on the under surface of leaves, \ngrowing shoots, fruiting bodies and stems along with ant colonies.\n• \nBoth nymphs and adults suck the cell sap from leaves and tender apical shootscauses \ncrinkling and curling of leaves\n• \nAphidsalso excrete honey dew on which black sooty mould develops impairing \nthephotosynthetic activity of the plant.\n• \nThe infested plants become weak, pale and stunted in growth\n12\nYellow mite or muranai mite: Polyphagotarsonemus latus\nSymptoms of damage\n• \nBoth nymphs and adults suck the sap from tender leaves and causes crinkling and \ndownward curling of leaves.\n• \nAffected leaves become narrow, twisted with elongated petiole. \n• \nThe affected leaves becoming inverted boat shaped and turning dark green in colour\n• \nClustering of younger leaves at the tip of branch\n• \nStunted growth of plants and dropping of flowers.\n13\nMajor diseases of chilli \nBacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum)\nSymptoms \n• \nSymptoms manifest initially as leaf drooping followed by wilting of entire plant \nwithin a few days. \n• \nRecently wilted plants look green, a distinct symptom when compared to other \nvascular wilt diseases which develops yellowing of the leaves. \n• \nVascular discoloration (brown) is also seen in the wilted plant. \n• \nDisease develops very rapidly in warm weather. \n• \nSymptoms are very clear during morning or immediately afer irrigation.\nChilli leaf curl disease (Begomovirus: Chilli leaf curl virus)\nVector: Whiteﬂy (Bemisia tabaci)\nSymptoms\n• \nUpward curling of leaves, puckering and reduced size of leaves.\n• \nShortening of internodes, vein clearing, vein swelling, vein thickening, and stunted \ngrowth.\n• \nAs infection progresses, symptoms of chlorosis, mosaic and mottling develop, and \ndistortion is more prominent. \n• \nTe size of leaves and branches is reduced considerably in severely aﬀected plants \nresulting in a bushy appearance. Such plants bear very few ﬂowers and very few \nfruits.\n• \nSeverely aﬀected plants were stunted and produced no fruit or fruit are small, \ndiscolored and distorted.\n14\n• \nIf the disease persists later in the life cycle, ﬂower buds will abscise and anthers will \nset without pollen grains, which ultimately results in poor fruit setting, resulting in \ndistorted or underdeveloped fruit.\nChilli veinal mottle disease (Potyvirus: Chilli veinal mottle virus, PVy)\nVector: Aphids (Aphis gossypii, Myzus persicae)\nSymptoms\n• \nMottling, vein banding, narrowing and distortion of leaves followed by stunted \ngrowth.\n• \nLeaf mottle and dark green vein-banding are the most characteristic symptoms. \n• \nLeaves of some cultivars are smaller and distorted. \n• \nSymptoms are most obvious on the younger, smaller leaves.\n• \nPlants infected when young become stunted and have dark-green streaks on their \nstems and branches.\n• \nMost of their ﬂowers drop before fruit formation. A few mottled, distorted fruit may \nbe produced. Such symptoms contribute to signiﬁcant yield losses.\n15\nNecrosis virus disease (Tospovirus: TSWV, GBNV, WBNV, CaCV)\nVector: Trips (Trips tabaci, Frankliniella schultzei, Scirtothrips dorsalis)\nSymptoms\n• \nYellow spots or patches followed by occasional chlorotic concentric rings on leaves. \n• \nBronzing and veinal necrosis of leaves.\n• \nNecrosis of terminal bud/ die-back of shoots are the characteristic symptom.\n• \nPlants infected early are bushy, stunted and die prematurely. In older plants, the \nsymptoms are restricted to a few branches only. \n• \nLeaf distortion in some cases.\n• \nChlorotic and necrotic spots and rings on leaves and fruits.\nFusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. capsici & F. solani)\nSymptoms\n• \nSymptoms may appear at two stages, viz. seedling wilt and adult plant wilt.\n• \nSeedlings show wilting afer 3-4 weeks of planting. Foliage of such seedlings turn \nyellow and plans exhibit wilt symptoms and later dry.\n• \nDisease symptoms ofen appear later in \nthe growing season and are ﬁrst noticed \non the lower (older) leaves. In older \nplants, the foliage turns to yellow and \ngradually leaves wilt.\n• \nAs the disease progresses, the younger \nleaves will also be aﬀected and the plant \neventually dies. \n• \nIn many cases, only one branch or part of \nthe plant shows symptoms (partial wilt).\n16\nFungal root rot disease (Phytophthora capsici, Sclerotium rolfsii, Macrophomina \nphaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani)\nSymptoms\n• \nSeedlings aﬀected by this infestation die soon afer germination.\n• \nGrowth of infected plants slows as compared to healthy plants.\n• \nYellowing of older leaves and falling of the leaves.\n• \nLeaf margins die and dry oﬀ.\n• \nPresence of light to dark brown lesions and discolouration on the lower portion of \nthe stem adjacent to the ground. Tis is followed by drooping and wilting of infected \nleaves and gradual wilting of the whole plant.\n• \nShredding of bark in the collar region can be seen in few cases. \n• \nRoots appear dark brown or black and few or no healthy, white roots or root tips. \nFruit rot/ anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici)\nSymptoms\n• \nPresence of small, circular spots on the \nskin of the fruit and later turned into \nlarge brown/ straw colour. \n• \nSeverely aﬀected fruits turned straw \ncoloured from normal red. On the \ndiscoloured \narea, \nnumerous \nblack \nfungal structures (acervuli) are seen. \n• \nInside of the diseased fruit was covered \nwith black stromatic masses of the \nfungus.

    "answer": "nd disease management technologies in chilli\nProblems/ Constraints\nChilli (Capsicum spp.) is an important commercial spice and vegetable crop. Pest \ninfestation is one of the major constraints in chilli production. Sucking insects viz., \nwhiteﬂies, thrips, aphids and mites and diseases like bacterial wilt, viral diseases, \nfusarium wilt and fruit rot are the major problem in chilli. Yield losses due to these \npest attacks may range from 25-50 %. Farmers use pesticides as ﬁrst line of defense and \nfrequently resort to indiscriminate and non-judicious use of pesticides.  However these \nmeasures lead to several problems such as environmental pollution, pesticide residue \nin the harvested products, development of resistance/resurgence and increased cost of \nproduction. Tese problems have necessitated the search for safer and eﬀective methods \nof pest control, including bio-control, botanical and bio-pesticides. \nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED\nStudies on seed treatment and six sprays with a plant growth promoting antagonistic \nbacterial bio-formulation (Goa Bio-2) @ 1.0%, spinosad (a natural product based \ninsecticide) @ 0.03%, insecticide (imidacloprid @ 0.03%) and other biological \ncomponents was conducted. Two years of ﬁeld evaluation indicated that seed treatment \nand spray of Goa Bio-2, spinosad recorded reduced ChiLCV disease incidence compared \nto control throughout the crop period. Green chilli yield of 34 to 40t/ha was recorded \nin Goa Bio-2, spinosad treatments which is 32 to 52 % increases compared to control.\nTECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION\nTis technology was demonstrated in 22 ha area of chilli under NABARD funded project \nin the state of Goa. More than 250 farmers were provided the inputs for demonstration \nfor two consecutive years (2019 to 2021). Based on the ﬁeld evaluation and considering \nthe ease of application, soil application of Goa Bio-2 @ 1.25g/plant and four sprays of \nspinosad (15, 30, 45 and 60 DAP) @ 0.03% was taken up. Disease incidence and dry \nchilli yield were recorded from about 50 demonstrations in each year. Results of two \nyears demonstrations indicated that 33% reduction in ChiLCV disease incidence and \n40% increase in dry chilli yield in the ﬁelds where soil application of Goa Bio-2 and \nspinosad spray treatment compared to control. Other beneﬁts of this technology include \nlesser incidence of thrips, whiteﬂies, aphids and other diseases the demonstration plots.\n46\n47\nI am managing a chilli ﬁeld of around 1000 sq. m and \nhad been facing severe problem due to the damage of \ninsect pest and diseases. Because of insect pest and \ndiseases, I used to loss around 25-30% yield in every \nyear. Tere was a great diﬃculty to manage these insect \npests and diseases. Tanks to ICAR-CCARI scientist for providing me Goa-bio-2, \nSpinosad and sticky traps. Tey solved our problems to the greater extent. Tere was a \nsigniﬁcant reduction in the damage caused by insect pests and diseases afer using Goa-\nbio-2, Spinosad and sticky traps. I got around10-15% more yield in chilli.\nSuccess stories\nPrasad Naik\nCumbarjua, Tiswadi,Goa\nMobile: 9504493384\nSuccess stories 1\nDhasharat Madgaonkar\nGiri Parra, Mapusa, Goa\nMobile: 9923765969\nSuccess stories 2\nI am growing diﬀerent types of vegetables like chilli, \nradish, cabbage, red amaranths etc. Chilli crop occupies \naround 500 sq.m ﬁeld area. A month afer planting \nthese vegetables I used \nto suﬀer from wilt and \nleaf curl diseases and sucking insect pest attack. With the \nassistance from ICAR-CCARI, I have started using Goa-\nbio-2, spinosad and sticky traps in vegetables especially \nin chilli. I could see that slowly the damage incidence of \ninsect pests has been reduced. So I used to apply Goa-\nbio-2, Spinosad and sticky traps to get good crop yield \nand more proﬁt. I thank ICAR-CCARI scientists for \nproviding me Goa-bio-2, Spinosad and sticky traps for \nlast 3 years. I have encouraged the other farmers in my \nneighbourhood to use Goa-bio-2, Spinosad and sticky \ntraps. Tank for ICAR-CCARI scientists.\n48\nI am having a chilli ﬁeld around 500sq.m area. Every \nyear I used to encounter with white ﬂy, thrips, aphids, \nwilt and leaf curl damage and a yield loss of around 25-\n40% every year in chilli crop. ICAR-CCARI provided \nus Goa-bio-2, chitosan and sticky traps. Tese products \nwere eﬀective in controlling the damage caused by insect pests and diseases and reduced \nthe loss of yield by 15-20%. Tere was signiﬁcant reduction in chilli pest and diseases \nlike white ﬂy, thrips, aphids,wilt etc. I would like to thank ICAR-CCARI and the concern \nscientist for providing me Goa-bio-2, chitosan and sticky traps.

A patch of three diamond  \nshaped yellowish white spots is visible by \njoining both the forewings, hence the name \n‘diamond back’. Young larvae feed by \nscrapping leaf tissues causing typical whitish \npatches on under side of leaves. Grown up larvae bite holes in the leaves. Damage to the  \ncrop is more in the main and late winter season as compared to rainy season crop in Northern \nregion.\nTobacco \ncaterpillar: \nCauses \nmaximum \ndamage from July to November to rainy \nseason crop. The adult moth is stout, brown \ncoloured, with wavy white markings on the \nforewings. Eggs are laid on leaves in masses \nand are covered with brown hairs. Neonate \nlarvae scrap the green matter in the leaf. Late \ninstars feed voraciously on tender leaves and fresh growth. The larvae are blackish gray to dark \ngreen with dark longitudinal bands on the side of the body. \nStem borer: Moths are pale greyish-brown, suffused with reddish \ncolour. Adult female lays eggs on the growing point or on the older \nleaves. Pale whitish brown with longitudinal stripes caterpillars initially \nmine the leaves and make it a white papery structure filled with their \nexcreta. Later these caterpillars bore into stem and multiple shoots are \nformed. As a result infested plants are killed forming side shoots which \ndon’t form heads. Entrance hole is covered with excreta.\nCabbage aphid: Aphids are serious during February – March months. \nAphids disappear due to good rain fall. As a result of sucking of vital sap \nfrom the tissues, plants remain stunted resulting in poor head formation. \nAphids also produce honey dew which makes the plant sticky and \nfavour the growth of sooty mold with black coating thus hindering the \nphotosynthesis and plant growth. \nCabbage/Cauliflower\n7\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Major Vegetable Crops\nDiseases\nDamping-off and wire stem: Damage results from the reduced \nplant stand and sometimes it is so serious that resowing becomes \ninevitable. Major symptoms are the failure of the seedlings to \nemerge as a result of seed or seedling decay or sudden death  \nof the emerged seedlings. In wire stem, light to dark brown  \nareas appear on the stem extending 1-2 cm below the soil line. \nAffected region is relatively thinner than the stems of the healthy \nplants.\nDowny mildew: Downy mildew is a serious \nproblem in cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli \nduring cool moist weather which favor sporulation, \ndissemination and infection. In nursery, the disease \nappears as irregular yellow patches on leaves with \nwhite fungal growth on the underside of the lesions. \nSevere infection leads to death of seedlings. On \nmature cabbage, downy mildew appears as dark \nsunken spots on the head or wrapper leaves resulting in purplish tinge.\nAlternaria leaf spot: They cause serious damage at all stages \ncausing heavy loss in yield and seed quality. On seedlings, minute \ndark spots appear on the cotyledons and seedling stem, causing \nsevere damping off or stunting of young plants. In older plants, all \nabove ground parts are attacked. The bottom leaves are infected first \nwhere brown circular spots with characteristic concentric rings (target \nspots) are seen. Infected leaves soon turn yellow and drop. Disease \ngets enhanced in a warm humid weather with temperature between  \n25 to 30oC. \nBacterial black rot: This disease is more severe \nin cauliflower than cabbage. Plants can be infected \nduring any crop stage. Seedlings drop lower leaves \nand may die. In grown up plants, infection occurs \nat margins. Infected tissue turns yellow and the \nchlorosis advances towards the centre of the leaf \nforming a wilted ‘V’ shape notch. Severely infected \nleaves may drop off. The head formation gets \naffected and heads of infected plants remain small and its quality is reduced. Head may rot if the \ndisease occurs late.\n8\nNCIPM\nValidated Integrated Pest Management strategies for \nCabbage / Cauliflower\nNursery Stage\nØ\t\nPrepare raised nursey beds about 10 cm above ground level \nfor good drainage to avoid damping off etc.\nØ\t\nFollow soil solarisation for 2-3 weeks using 0.45 mm thick \npolythene sheet.

Grubs are yellowish in colour, stout and have \nspines all over their body. Eggs are cigar-shaped, yellowish in colour \nand laid in groups generally on the lower surface of leaves with their \ntips pointing. Grubs and adults scrap the leaves chlorophyll, feed on \nthe green matter and totally skeletonise the leaves leaving veins and \nveinlets and forming ladder-like windows. \nAphids: Nymphs and adults suck the sap from the leaves and the \naffected plants turn yellow, get deformed and dry away. Aphids also \nsecrete copious quantity of honeydew on which sooty mould grows, \ncovering the affected parts with a thick black coating which hampers \nthe photosynthetic activity.\nLeaf roller: Full grown caterpillars (20 mm) are stout, purple brown \nand ornamented with yellow spots and hairs. Pupation is in folded \nleaves. The larvae also roll up the leaves and feed on the green \nmatter while remaining inside the folds and thus lead a concealed life. \nUltimately the folded leaves wither and dry up. \nLeaf hopper: The adult is wedge-shaped about 2 mm long and pale \ngreen in colour. They are found between the veins of leaves on the \nundersurface and suck the sap. The infested leaves curl upward along \nthe margin, which may later turn yellowish, crinkle and show burnt up \npatches. Plants become stunted and may be killed in severe cases and \nfruit set is adversely affected by the infestation.\nShoot and fruit borer: It is the most destructive pest. Moths have \nconspicuous black and brown patches and dots on white forewings. Eggs \nare laid singly on leaves, shoots, flower buds and occasionally on fruits. \nLight pink larvae initially bore into shoots and the growing point is killed. \nFecal pellets are seen at entrance hole. Appearance of wilted, drooping \nshoots is the typical symptom. The larvae also attack the fruits making \ntheir entry under the calyx when they are young. Later larvae bore \ninto fruits which show exit holes and become partially unfit for human \nconsumption, loose their market value. \nBRINJAL\n11\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Major Vegetable Crops\nDiseases \nDamping off: It appears in two stages as pre-emergence and post \nemergence. In pre-emergence, seeds rot before emergence while in post \nemergence, seedlings topple down at the soil surface. \nPhomopsis blight and fruit rot: Pathogen attacks seedlings soon after \nemergence. Leaf spots first appear as small gray to brown lesions with \nlight centers which become numerous and cover large areas of leaves. \nLesions may also develop on petiole and stem, causing blighting of \naffected portion. Symptoms on the infected fruits appear as minute, \nsunken dull and dusky spots. Fruit lesions are sunken, discoloured with \nmargin of black fruit bodies.\nLittle leaf: The characteristic symptom is the small or little leaves. The \npetioles are so short that the leaves appear to be sticking to the stem. \nInternodes of the stem are also shortened. Petioles and leaves remain \nshortened giving the plant a bushy appearance. Mostly there is no \nflowering and fruiting is rare. The mycoplasma is transmitted by the plant \nhopper Hishimonas phycitis.\nMites\nRed spider mite: Usually the infestation is noticed following indiscriminate \nuse of insecticides, especially pyrethroids. Adults are reddish brown with \nfour pairs of legs. Larvae are pink in colour while nymphs are greenish \nred in colour. Colonies of larvae, nymphs and adults feed on the under \nsurfaces of leaves, make webs. As mite numbers increase these white \nspeckles will increase in number, the leaf will take on a bleached \nappearance and die. Affected leaves gradually start curling and finally \nget shriveled, wrinkled and crumpled. \nNematodes\nRoot-knot nematode: The most characteristic symptom of nematode \ndamage is the formation of knots or galls on the root system. Galls may \noccur singly or several galls may coalesce to form very massive galls. \nPlants show stunted growth, leaves show chlorotic and wilting symptoms. \nFruiting is adversely affected. Affected fields give patchy look with poorly \ngrown, stunted plants. \n12\nNCIPM\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Interventions for \nBrinjal Crop\nNursery Stage\nØ\t\nGreen manuring with sunhemp / Dhaincha in July-August. \nØ\t\nRaised seed bed about 10 cm above ground level for good \ndrainage to avoid damping off etc.\nØ\t\nCover the nursery beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge \n(0.45 mm) thicknesses for three weeks during June for soil \nsolarisation which will help in reducing the soil borne insects, diseases like bacterial wilt and \nnematodes.

Both \nadults and nymphs damage the \ncrop and lacerate the leaf tissue \nand suck the sap. Tender shoots, \nbuds and flowers are attacked as \na result they become twisted and deformed, upward curling of leaves is seen· Pest infestation \nincreases at high temperature.\nAphids: Occurs mainly in dry, cloudy, cool and humid weather \nconditions during February –April while heavy rains wash away the \naphid colonies. Aphids are small, succulent, pear-shaped insects \nthat vary in color from yellow to green to black. Appear on the \ntender shoots and on the lower surface of the leaves. Suck the sap \nand reduce the vigour of the plants. Secrete sweet substances \nwhich attract ants and develops sooty mold.\nBorers\nTobacco caterpillar: Tobacco caterpillar adult is brown in colour.

Nymphs and \nadults of leaf hopper are pale greenish, \nwedge shaped with a pair of black spots on \nvertex and a black spot on posterior portion \nof each of the forewings and move in a \npeculiar fashion diagonally. Both nymphs \nand adult suck cell sap from the undersurface of leaves and inject toxins. The affected leaves \nturn yellowish and curl upwards along the margins. In case of heavy infestation the leaves turn \ndark brick red ‘hopper burn’’.\nShoot and fruit borer: The incidence of shoot & fruit borer usually \noccurs during humid conditions after rain fall. Larva bores into terminal \nshoots of young plants leading to death of the shoots. With the \nformation of the buds, flowers and fruits, the caterpillars bore inside \nthese and feed on inner tissues. Infected buds & flowers will shed. \nEntrance hole is plugged with excreta. Fruits become deformed in \nshape with no market value. \nWhite fly: Female lays stalked yellow spindle shaped eggs singly on \nthe lower surface of the leaf. Nymphs are oval, scale like and remain \nattached to the leaf surface. Adults are tiny, with yellowish body and \nwings coated with milky white waxy powder. Nymphs and adults suck \nthe sap usually from the under surface of the leaves and excrete \nhoneydew. Leaves appear sickly and get coated with sooty mold. \nPlant shows stunted growth. It also transmits the vein mosaic virus. \nAphid: These are polyphagous pests. Nymphs are light yellowish \nblack or brownish. Adults are mostly wingless but few winged forms \nalso seen. Cool and humid conditions are favourable for multiplication \nwhile it disappears due to good rain fall. Colonies of these nymphs and \nadults are found often on tender shoots and as a result of sucking of vital \nsap from the tissues crinkling and curling of leaves takes place. Leaves \nappear shiny and sticky due to honeydew excreted by the aphids. Later \nsooty mould grows on honeydew and leaves have a black coating. \nOKRA\n21\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Major Vegetable Crops\nDiseases\nYellow vein mosaic: There is a presence of characteristic symptom \nof interwoven network of yellow veins encompassing with islands \nof green tissues on leaves. Later, entire leaves turn yellow. The \nplants remain stunted or yellowish green in colour. Infection restricts \nflowering and fruits, if formed, may be smaller, yellowish and harder. \nThis disease, spread by white fly, is economically most important \ndisease of okra. Sometimes the losses exceed more than 80%. \nPowdery mildew: White floury spots or patches appear on the \nundersurface of the leaves which later spread to both the leaf \nsurfaces. Initially white superficial spots appear on leaves, but entire \nsurface may be covered with powdery mass. Severely affected \nleaves turn yellow and shriveled. Severe infection will cause the \nleaves to roll upward and scorch. It may result in heavy leaf shed. \nMites\nRed spider mite: The infestation of mites is mostly observed during \nthe warm and dry period of the season. Larvae & nymphs are pink, \ngreenish red in colour while adults are oval, reddish brown in colour. \nMites feed on the under surface of leaves and as a result of feeding \nwhitish grey patches appear on the leaves. The affected leaves \ngradually start curling and finally get wrinkled, mottled, crumpled, \nturn brown and fall.\nNematodes\nRoot knot nematode: Second stage larvae infect the plant by \nentering the roots. There they feed and moult to reach adult hood. \nThey feed vigorously on roots and cause characteristic knots or \ngalling of roots. Galls may occur singly or several galls may coalesce \nto form very massive galls.

Thrips are found in the axil of green leaves where these sucks \njuice of early-emerging leaves. Small white silvery patches are seen \nall over the leaves. The infested plants show stunted growth with \ntwisted leaves. If the infestation comes in early stage of growth, bulb \nformation stops completely.\nDiseases\nDamping off: In pre-emergence damping \noff, seedlings are killed before they reach \nthe soil surface. Post emergence is \ncharacterised by the toppling of seedlings \nanytime after they emerge from the soil. It is more common during \nkharif season with temperature and humidity are high\nStemphyllium blight: It is common in Northern and Eastern India. \nIts severity varies from 5 to 50 % and is more severe in rabi than \nkharif crop during March and April. Small yellow to pale orange spots \nor streaks develop on middle of leaves stalk on one side. The spots \nfrequently coalesce into extended patches to cover the entire foliage. \nIn seed crop, inflorescence stalk is severely damaged.\nPurple blotch: It is common during kharif season. Hot and humid \nclimate with temperature of 25-30oC and relative humidity of 80-90 % \nfavour development and spread of the diseases. Disease appears as \nsmall whitish sunken lesions which enlarge and coalesce covering the \nentire leaf. Concentric zones may develop within the lesions\nNematodes\nRice root-knot nematode: Usually young seedlings are infected \nand thus may result in complete destruction of crop.

Maximum damage occurs during July-August. \nGravid female inserts the white, cigar shaped eggs into the flowers and / or tender fruits. The newly \nhatched maggots bore into the fruit pulp by forming serpentine galleries and feed inside, contaminating \nthem with its frass and providing entry points for saprophytic fungi and bacteria, which cause rotting \nof the fruits. Due to feeding, there is pre-mature dropping of fruits. \nCucurbits\nCucumber Moth: The larvae are pale to dark green with a white \nstripe running along both sides of the body. Caterpillars scrap the \nchlorophyll portion of the leaves by webbing them together. It also \nbores into flowers and after the fruit starts to develop, the larvae \ncan chew shallow holes in the surface.\nRed Pumpkin Beetle: It is serious pest of bottle gourd. Adult \nbeetles are mainly responsible for the damage of the plant above \nground, attacking on the leaves, flowers and fruits. Making holes \nand causing death or retardation of growth. In case of heavy \ninfestation, re-sowing is required to be done. Larvae live in the soil \nand feed on the roots and stem of the plant. \nWhite fly: Both the nymphs and adults suck the plant sap mainly \nfrom underside of the leaves and secrete honeydew on which black \nsooty-moulds develops which in turn reduces photosynthesis by \nthe plants. Apart from causing direct damage by their feeding, they \nalso act as vector of viral diseases. \n28\nNCIPM\nLeaf Miner: Serpentine mines are made by larvae in leaves. Drying and \ndropping of leaves due to severe infestation. Adults are pale yellow in \ncolour. Pupates within mines.\t\nDiseases: \nDowney mildew: It is one of the serious diseases which initiates as water \nsoaked angular lesions under conditions of high humidity and moderate \ntemperature, soon turning chlorotic and finally on the corresponding \nlower surface purplish during growth is seen.\nCercospora leaf spot: The disease occurs \non almost all cucurbits but is more common \non cucumber, bitter gourd and bottle gourd \nand is usually found on foliage. Small \nblock circular spots with grey centre with \nyellow hold appear on leaves. These sports \nenlarge and later encircle the leves. Severely \ninfected leaves fall off. The fruit size is reduced. More prevalent during \nrainy season.\nFusarium wilt: The symptoms are expressed at flowering & fruiting stage \nin bottle gourd and water melon. Replacement of tap root by a number \nof lateral roots. Yellowing, droping of leaves and wilting and druing of \nwhole plant are the major symptoms. Caused by seed borne and soil \nborne fungus. Vascular bundles in the collar region become discolorered \n/ brown.\nPowdery mildew: The characteristic white, powdery fungal growth is \nreadily recognizable on leaves, stems and vines. It is observed on almost \nall cucurbits and causes considerable loss. Affected leaves wither and \ndry. Powdery mildew affects fruit quality and reduces yield by reducing \nnumber and size of fruit.\nAnthracnose: Yellowish water soaked spots appear which enlarge and \nturn dry brownish black with centre giving shot hole appearance. On \nfruits spots are circular sunken with dark borders containing numerous \npin head size fruiting bodies.\nVirus complex: This disease is serious constraint in cucurbits which \ncause leaf curl, yellow mosaic and stunting.

They have a ferocious appearance, \nwhich misleads people into thinking they are harmful, which is untrue. Cannablism is also observed \nin lady bird beetle. C. septumpunctata: Adult is half pea shaped, yellow to reddish brown with 7 black \nspots on elytra, both the head and ventral side are blackish in colour. Pupa is light brown marked \nwith black dot and fixed on leaves at the posterior end. Egg is 1.2 mm long and yellowish in colour. \nMenochilus sexmaculatus: It is a black-spotted lady beetle. The long and narrow black band at the \npronotal base is connected to the transverse oval black discal spot by a short and narrow longitudinal \nconstriction or line. \nCommon Natural Enemies in Vegetable Crops\nGreen lace wing (Chrysoperla carnea): Chrysopa feeds on aphids, mites, jassids, whitefly, thrips, \nbollworms and many other small insects. Adults are of medium size, 1-2 cm long, green, yellow \ngreen or sometimes brownish with golden eyes and delicate netted wings. The larvae, which are very \nactive, are gray or brownish and alligator-like with well-developed legs and large pincers and grow \nfrom <1 mm to 6-8 mm. Oval shaped eggs are laid singly at the end of long silken talks and are pale \ngreen, turning gray in several days. Young larvae are susceptible to dessication. They need a source \nof moisture. \n34\nNCIPM\nSpiders (Neosiana sp, Thomisus sp.): Spiders are generalist & \nexcellent predators feeding on many insects; some spider species  \nuse webs to capture prey while other species stalk their prey. Some  \nof the spiders feed even on ants. Orb weavers, they frequently  \nremake their webs to catch prey, recycling - i.e. eating - the old web in the \nprocess.\nSyrphid fly (Ischiodon scutellaris Fabricius): Many species of syrphid fly \nare predacious on aphids, and also mealy bugs, whiteflies, lepidopterous \nlarvae and beneficial insects. Adults are usually brightly coloured, resembling \nbees and wasps. Syrphid larvae vary in appearance and habits. They are \neither obligate or facultative predators. The larvae are somewhat slug-like \nand are tapering towards head. Pupae are typically tear-drop shaped. \nPraying mantis (Mantis religiosa): Praying mantis are predators and hunt \non living insects. Large mantis feed on lizards, rodents, frogs, birds and \neven snakes. They wait for their prey to come close and quickly catch it. \nThe mantis uses its two front legs to attack it’s prey. They are active during \nnight. The adult praying mantis ranges in size from a centimeter to several \ninches in length. They blend themselves in surrounding and have very good \neyesight; Sexual cannabilism is also seen.\nDragonfly (Libellula saturate): They act as a predator as they feed on \nmosquitos and other harmful small insects like bees, butterflies and flies. \nTheir larvae are aquatic. They hold their prey tightly in legs studded with \nspikes. They catch their prey using extendable jaws. The life span of adult \ndragonfly is only few months. It’s most of the life is spent in the larval stage \nunderneath the water surface. Female dragonfly lay eggs in or near water, \noften on floating or emergent plants. The larval stage of large dragonflies \nmay last as long as five years.\nDamsel fly (Agriocnemis pygmaea): They occur on aquatic vegetation \nand on the bottom of streams and ponds. They feed on aquatic insects and \nother arthropods. Damselfly adults use their hind legs which are covered \nwith hairs to capture prey. They hold the prey in their legs and devour it by \nchewing. Adults are commonly found near water. Damselflies have long \nthin bodies that are often brightly colored with green, blue, red, yellow, \nblack or brown.\n35\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Major Vegetable Crops\nTrichogramma sp (Trichogramma chilonis, T. japonicum, T. \nbrasiliensis and other Trichogramma spp): Trichogramma are \nextremely tiny wasps. They are parasites of borers. Parasitised egg \ncards may be stapled to the underside of the leaves of the plant, so \nthat the parasitoids may emerge and attack the host eggs. Each female \nparasitizes about 100 eggs. The short life cycle allows the wasp population \nto increase rapidly. Trichogramma is active at a optimum temperature of \n23-25°C with 75% humidity. Conservation of parasite is important using crop management practices \nthat protect and encourage natural enemies and increase their impact on pests. Trichogramma are \nreadily available from commercial suppliers. \nNuclear polyhedrosis virus: NPV is a specific disease. Virus solution is \nsprayed on plants @ 250 LE / ha. preferably in the evening with adjuvants \nlike jaggery solution 0.5% and 0.1% of any spreader / sticker or detergent \npowder. It is highly effective against tobacco caterpillar and fruit borer on \nall vegetable crops. The larvae get infected with NPV once they eat virus-\ncontaminated foliage. The infected larva becomes sluggish and stops \nfeeding. Later, the infected larva turns black. It is seen hanging on the \nfoliage. Nuclear polyhedrosis viruses have numerous polyhedral inclusion bodies which contain rod-\nshaped viral particles. It is safe to honeybees, fish, mammals & natural enemies of insects & can be \nstored in cool place. \nPredatory wasps (Vespa orientalis): Yellow \nwasps prey on many insects that are considered \nto be pests. They do also prey on bees, but unlike \nhoney bees, these waps colonies die out at the \nonset of every winter. Each social wasp colony \nincludes a queen and a number of female workers \nwith varying degrees of sterility relative to the queen. \nSize and composition of colony varies and it ranges from few dozens to many thousands. Common \nmanifestation of wasps stings to man are related to allergy. \nCotesia (Cotesia sp): Cotesia is a parasite of caterpillars like tobacco \ncaterpillar and gram caterpillar. Cotesia sp adults are small, dark wasps \nand resemble tiny flies. They have two pairs of wings, the hind wings \nbeing smaller than the forewings. The antennae are about 1.5 mm long \nand curved (not elbowed) upward. The abdomen of the female narrows \nto a downward curving extension called the ovipositor with which she \nlays eggs. The pupae are in an irregular mass of yellow silken cocoons \nattached to the host larva or to plant leaves. \nIllis cinta: It feeds on powdery mildew spores.\n36\nNCIPM\nNeem seed kernels should be pulverized using \nan electrical households mixer / grinder or by \nusing a mortar and pestle. Winnowing should \nbe done to separate the shell from the kernel. \nPulverised neem seed kernel particles should \npass through 18-mesh sieve. After sieving \nthe powder should be mixed with water in the \nratio of 100 g : 300 ml. The adjuvant (soap \n/ detergent powder) should then be added \nto mixture in the ratio of 5 ml / gram of the \nadjuvant for every 100 grams of neem kernel \nseed powder. This mixture should be allowed \nto stand overnight. In the morning, it should be stirred and strained through a muslin cloth. More \nwater must be passed through the residue left on the muslin cloth just adequate to adjust the \nratio of neem kernel powder to water in the filterate becomes 100 gm powder in 2 litre water. The \nfilterate should again be stirred to get a creamy dispersion of NSKE, ready for spraying. Spraying \nshould preferably be carried out in the evening when the intensity of UV rays is low and while \nspraying thorough coverage of foliage is must. \nGraphic Presentation of NSKE Preparation\nNeem seed kernel\n↓\nGrind\n↓\nSoak in water overnight\n↓\nFilter through muslin cloth\n↓\nAdd 1% detergent\n↓\nPrepare 5% solution and spray\n↓\nFor one ha: 25 kg kernel\n↓\n500 litres water + 5 kg detergent\nPreparation of Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE)\n37\nValidated Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Major Vegetable Crops\nAPPLICATION OF OTHER BIOPESTICIDES \nNuclear polyhedrosis virus (HaNPV): First spraying is to be done as soon as newly hatched \nlarvae are seen. Repeat the spray after 7-10 days. Spray preferably in evening hours when \nintensity of UV rays is less and thorough coverage of foliage is must. Add sticker like Teepol or \nTriton X-100 while spraying. Collect the NPV infected larvae from field, crush and spray in the \nfield. \t\nBacillus thuringiensis: Prepare a homogenous paste first, then dilute 1 kg of B.t.k. in 500 litres \nof water. Apply preferably during evening hours.\nTrichoderma mixing: Mix 250 gm of effective strain of fungal antagonist Trichoderma in 3 kg of \nFYM and leave for about seven days for enrichment of culture. FYM should have sufficient (10%) \nmoisture in it. After 7 days, mix in the soil in a nursery bed of 3 sq.m. (3mx1m). Solution of 4% of \nT.harzianum can be prepared for seedling dip.\n38\nNCIPM\nA.\t\nPurchase\n\t\n1.\t\nAlways purchase only required quantity of pesticides and not in bulk\n\t\n2.\t\nNever purchase loose or unsealed containers.
